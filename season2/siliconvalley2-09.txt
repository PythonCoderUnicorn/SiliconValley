Hey could we get one more round please

Its on a tab Bighetti

Sure Coming up

Cool Thanks

Well well look whos the big shot

Yeah big shot

How are you guys

Uh everything good over at Nucleus

Nucleus is dog shit How do you do it man

You used to be the most useless guy in the entire Nucleus team but now you run an entire division

Did you ever ask yourself why

No No I never have

Do you have any skill at all other than magically failing your way to the top

I have a boat

I guess thats not really a skill

fucking Big Head man

fucking Big Head

Take care

Oh hey

Hey you forgot your phone

At least I think this is your

Holy shit

Holy shit

Right

This is Nucleus

Yep

That is a beta of their entire mobile platform and it sucks

Yeah I mean the UX is like Sovietera

When it stores photos they actually get larger

They never cracked middleout

I actually kind of wish you didnt show me this because now I know we totally would have beaten them

As it is now I mean we cant get funded

All of our new coders quit

I mean can you even imagine what would happen if like a tech blog got their hands on that piece of shit

Theyd tear it apart I mean it could actually totally destroy Nucleus release

I bet Gavin would do shit anything to prevent that from happening right

Yeah totally

Jesus Richard am I actually ahead of you on this

Take the phone man

Its yours Take it

Are are you serious

Yeah dude Come on I owe you

I mean I was about to quit Hooli and move home

And then Gavin promoted me just to spite you

And now he keeps promoting me for some inexplicable reason

I mean I havent done anything Richard I mean less than nothing

Well yeah

But look at me now

Were sitting on my boat Richard and thats because of you

Soon we can sail it to fucking Hawaii or Sausalito

Three more classes and I get my boat license

Oh really How many classes does it take

Three Its three classes

I heard you can pay somebody to take the test for you but I just havent got around to it yet

theme music playing

Gavin Enough with your coy bullshit Richard okay

I know you have my gddmn phone

What the fuck do I have to do to get it back

Well I was thinking that in exchange for my help you

Im sorry hold on

You cant use the term in exchange

It implies causality Thats basically extortion

Any actions he takes must be uncoerced and of his own volition

Go

Hello Its me again

I was thinking that if you found your phone you might be so happy that you would be inclined to drop the lawsuit

Why would I do that

Because if you found your phone that would mean that no tech bloggers or journalists did and they couldnt write a scathing review based on what was on it as it sucks

Who knows It might even cause Hooli stock to crash or certain careers to be ruined

Richard are you threatening me

Uh am I threatening you

Thats a good question

Um no

If you dont give me my fucking phone back Im gonna find you bend you over your desk and fuck you so hard your front teeth

Hold on

You cant threaten him especially not sexually

This little shit could cause major damage here

What am I allowed to say

Richard its me again

Yes

Heres my concern

If my phone ends up in the hands of a journalist Palo Alto Chief of Police Ed Gaskins who apropos of nothing happens to be a close personal friend of mine would have to go and ask this person where they got my phone

Keep in mind these arent real journalists Richard

Theyre tech journalists

Do you think theyd go to prison to protect their source

I dont either

And since this phones OS is a stolen prototype worth 40 to 60 million youre looking at felony grand theft Richard

You can go to jail for 40 years

Then again youd probably be fine in a fullblown hard time penitentiary

I mean after they waxed your rectum and knocked out all your front teeth just to make things easier

snickers

You know Gavin if you dont want my help then I guess well just see what happens

All right Richard

So what do we do here

I dont know

What do we do here

Paul are you there

Ron

Hey buddy

Sam and Melinda there too

They are They say hi

Hey Ron

Ron What up kids

Let me hit you back in 10 and well sidebar this

Binding arbitration Whats that

Well its like a trial but massively accelerated

Next week were gonna go in front of a retired judge and argue our whole lawsuit in just two days and then were done

So this will all be resolved next week

Ive always wanted to go to binding arbitration

A weird thing to have always wanted to do

Everybody whos ever sued me has settled out of court Pussies

Now finally Ill be able to take the stand be a part of the big show

No show This is a serious legal proceeding okay

And speaking to that Ron Laflamme has got us a new litigator and we are meeting him in an hour

Um how are we gonna pay this person

Our guy has agreed to wave his entire fee until our case is resolved

Oh its some wet behind the ears noob straight out of law school

No he is said to be very experienced one of the best in the biz

Then why the fuck would he take our case on spec

Was I in possession of coca1ne amphetamines amyl nitrate also known as poppers at the time of my arrest

In large quantities

Did I have consensual intercourse with two women under the age of 18

Repeatedly I admit this

Did I violate the Mann Act and transport them across state lines for sexual purposes

Alleged but not proven

And boy they tried They tried

Therefore I was incarcerated and I was disbarred

Wait hold on You were disbarred

So you cant practice law

Not in open court in the State of California

Thats correct But this is arbitration

Im really grateful for the opportunity

Im turning my life around

Ive served my time

Questions

I guess I have one at least

Um what does amyl nitrate do

Oh it dilates the anus

That is accurate

Also produces euphoria

Okay thank you Pete and Jared

Sure

al dilation aside what do you think of our case

You think were gonna go in there and just dickslap those Hooli pieces of shit

I have reviewed your case and it is extremely strong

Thank God

I do every day of my life

Its only by His grace that I was able to survive that plunge into the ravine and 11 months in the state penitentiary

Im sorry were you in an emotional ravine or did you actually go into a ravine

Both

Now with your approval I would like to move forward

I currently am not in possession of an office and Im residing in a halfway house so I would like to give Hooli legal your home address

Why

They need to send over their discovery documents all of them

All of them

This is craziness

Couldnt they have just emailed all this

I mean its mostly just printedout emails anyway

Yeah of course they could have

And it would have been digitally searchable and that is the point

Its a classic document dump

But what they didnt take into account is the power of us

So grab a box guys

Start pulling anything you think is relevant

And you may have to work pretty hard but it will free us from this lawsuit

Are you saying work will set you free

Yes They have the manpower

We have the perseverance Triumph of the will

Hes the most cheerful person Ive ever heard quote htler

So Hoolis entire intellectual property claim boils down to three simple questions

Did your work on Pied Piper at any time overlap with your scope of work or Hooli business

Uh no

Did you ever do work on Pied Piper on Hooli time

Uh no

And at no time did you ever use Hooli equipment to develop Pied Piper in any way

No never

Were on our way then You just tell that honestly to the court and were home free

Okay

Unless of course youve offered a conflicting version of that to anyone

A friend your parents a girlfriend

No no and not possible

I havent had a girlfriend in like three years

A boyfriend

No Im not gay just busy

Were not litigating your sexuality

Thats good yeah

Its a good thing too because if we were wed all end up in prison Am I right

No offense

Here I did a first pass Let me know what you think

Just a few questions for you to ask me while Im on the stand

Its rough clay We can shape it as we go

You realize I have no intention of ever putting you on the stand

What Why not

Well I just dont think you have anything to offer the case

Theyre trying to say that Pied Piper was created at Hooli whereas Im living proof that it was created here in my incubator

I nurtured Richard like a little baby

I was his patron like the Borgias with Da Vinci

Actually the Medici were Da Vincis patrons

The Borgias poisoned people

Say Medici again Medici

Shut the fuck up

Thats how you pronounce it

Lets be clear okay The burden of proof falls on Hooli here And they have none

You have a Barrett 50caliber r1fle at your disposal that you can use to shoot Gavin Belson in the gddmn face

And youre not gonna use it What kind of fucking attorney are you

Well technically I cant refer to myself as an attorney until Im reinstated and make restitution to my victims families

Im a lawyer And Im a good one

And if you know one end of a Barrett 50cal from the other Ill eat a bowl of shit

Did you get a taste for that on the inside hmm

Hey guys its been almost two weeks since the mother condor has been to the nest

Do you think something may be wrong with the egg

Something is Its on our website

No really I mean I think maybe I should call the museum see if this is normal

Jared you want that egg to be alive right

Of course

Well right now because you dont know whether it is or not it exists in both states like Schrodingers cat

Like what

Its a quantum mechanics thought experiment that an Austrian physicist came up with to help understand quantum states

So he imagined putting a cat into a box with poisoned food

Theres a 5050 chance the cat eats it

That does sound rather Austrian

So according to Schrodinger if you open the box and confirm that the cat is dead then in a sense youve klled the cat

Or if you call the museum and get the information then youve klled the egg

No thats silly

Is it

Okay

Im just gonna think about it for a minute




    push

Richard

Yeah

We have a problem

Whats up

You and I are going into arbitration tomorrow

I need you to look me right in the eye and tell me why youve been lying to me

I havent been lying to you

You told me you havent had a girlfriend for three years

I have found at least 15 emails to Nelson Bighetti in the last year where you reference a girlfriend

Spent the day in bed with my girlfriend

A homeless guy in the coffee shop almost stole my girlfriend

Its a joke Big Head and I

We call my laptop my girlfriend because its the only warm thing thats touched my crotch in a little while

So when you said quote My girlfriend shit the bed last night that was your laptop

Laptop yeah

Well thats good to hear

Oh wait a minute

Wait a minute Wait a minute

Now listen to this

April 10th 1114 PM

Taking my girlfriend to the Apple store

April 12th 342 PM

Picking my girlfriend up at the mall

Yeah so

So your laptop was in the shop for three days right

The 10th through the 12th right

Yeah and

April 11th 248 PM

Ran a test of the perceptual modeler during lunch made a few tweaks and wow its working on a whole new level

Yeah that just means that its going great that its working really well

Richard Richard you didnt have your laptop with you at Hooli

What computer did you use to run that test that day

Oh shit

Richard you didnt use a Hooli computer

Tell me that you didnt use a Hooli fucking computer

I I dont know Yeah yeah okay

Yes I I think I did

fuck I mean I just used it once though right

I mean thats not Thats not a big deal

Its a huge deal Were done Thats it

Whats it

God damn it

Well under the law Hooli can lay claim to the underlying intellectual property that makes up Pied Piper

So were fucked now is that it Were totally fucked

Well I mean it all depends on whether or not the attorneys at Hooli figure out that your girlfriend is your laptop

Are you telling us this entire case hinges on people believing that Richard had a girlfriend

We are fucked

All right this is gonna be a long two days so lets try to keep things brief

Your Honor I think I can help speed things along

We are willing to concede to all the numerous counts brought by Mr Belson except the ones regarding the ownership of intellectual property

Is that right

On the nonsolicit violation my client is willing to concede that Donald Dunn was improperly hired

And on the unjust enrichment charge Richard will agree to repay Hooli 39 dollars and 99 cents for the phone charger that he took home and so on

Thank you Mr Monahan for accelerating the process

Okay lets start this Plaintiff

Okay Richard here it goes

They call you first were toast

I think Im gonna puke

Your Honor wed like to call our first witness

We would like to call Nelson Bighetti aka Big Head

Wait are you sure Cause it says no admittan

Okay

Yeah you were right Its this one

Is that me

whispers Im sorry Richard

Firstly sir let me say it is a privilege to be speaking to someone as accomplished as you

Okay

You were one of the earliest members of the Pied Piper team were you not

Uh

And since your departure your rise has been meteoric

Havent you received three Hooli promotions in a month

Uh yeah Yeah I guess that is right

It seems like everything you touch is made dramatically better Mr Bighetti

You make a meaningful and crucial contribution to everything you do do you not

Wa wait

Im Im sorry Do I not

Are you asking if I do do that or if I dont do that

This is amazing They have nothing

Its a desperate play

Theyre trying to build him up make it seem like he was a crucial part of Pied Piper

Its a Hail Mary They have nothing

Because if I dont not do that isnt that the same as

Lets move on

Okay

Is it not true that Wired

Ill rephrase

Did Wired Magazine run a cover story on you

Yes or no

Oh yes

That did happen yes

Jared I think I just made a mistake

That was the museum

I decided to call and check on the condor and they said that its very unlikely that the condor egg is still alive

But my phone call itself drew their attention to their low viewing numbers and theyve decided to take down the cameras today

So by making the phone call youve most likely klled the condor egg

Oh come on I mean that Schrodinger stuffs all just theoretical

It doesnt apply here

Doesnt it

I mean look at Richard

He didnt know that he had tested on a Hooli computer until Monahan opened that box of emails right

So Richard was both innocent and guilty but as soon as Monahan opened that box it made Richard guilty

But I mean by that logic anyone who goes to an opencasket funeral is a mrderr

You are one dark mtherfucker Jared

So Mr Bighetti you have stated that you didnt have anything to do with Pied Piper

No

I suppose youd also say that you had nothing to do with Hooli XYZ either

No not really

And what about the Hooli AIDS and Cancer Societies of which you were president Did you have anything to do with those

Honestly not really I actually remember when they told me I got the AIDS thing for just a second I thought they were telling me that I had AIDS

But then I realized no I was just the president of the AIDS thingy

But for a second it was pretty scary there

You see Your Honor Nelson Bighetti is pathologically modest

While he humbly denies credit the record shows that he had everything to do with all of these achievements

It may be possible that Nelson actually believes he didnt have that much to do with the founding of Pied Piper either

Cause

But it is painfully obvious that he had a huge hand in it

No further questions Your Honor

May I say Mr Bighetti how refreshing it is to finally encounter someone in the tech community who is so free of pretension and ego

Well that was troubling

Yeah what was that

Its just that he scored big points with the judge in there

So whats our plan Do we go in there and cross the shit out of him

Tear him a new hole in his butt

Lets just remind ourselves here that he gave me the phone and made this whole thing possible

So lets take it easy on him

Yeah I dont think shredding him is the right way to go either

Thank you It could backfire turn the judge against us

I have something else in mind

Mr Bachmann are you still prepared to testify

fuck yes I am

Mr Bachmann

Yes sir

You are the owner and sole proprietor of the Palo Altobased hacker hostel in which Mr Hendricks and Mr Bighetti both resided Is that correct

Yes sir That is in fact correct

It has been called the Garden of Tech Eden

Is it also fair to say that every instinct you have as a businessman has been completely and totally wrong

Sorry what

You hard of hearing Mr Bachmann

No Ive heard everything

Arent you considered a joke in this town

I dont quite know where youre going with this

Nor do I Can you tell us where youre headed here Mr Monahan

Your Honor if you are to accept Hoolis reverence for Mr Bighetti as proof that hes a genius then you must also accept Mr Bachmanns reverence for Mr Bighetti as proof that hes a moron

Im simply establishing this type of logic Your Honor cuts both ways

I see Ill allow it

Really Because I dont

Mr Bachmann you have incubated a seemingly endless string of patently unsuccessful apps havent you

No No that is not correct

I incubated Pied Piper I saw the value in that

Oh did you Isnt it true that you were about to evict Mr Hendricks until he became the subject of a bidding war

You disliked Pied Piper

The one app in your hostel that showed promise

Well I think thats a bit harsh I mean ev

In fact you tried to encourage Mr Hendricks to change his app to be more like Mr Bighettis horrendous app called Nip Alert Isnt that true

Well yes I thought Nip Alert showed great promise

It did not show great promise

What it showed was the location of nearby women possessing erect nipples

And as such Mr Bighettis grotesque creation was passed over by every investor in this town except you because it was perverted

Well Ill admit that Ill concede that the cultural moment may have passed but at the time

No at the time it was as misogynistic as it is now wasnt it Mr Bachmann

It yes it had some major problems

Some major problems Mr Bachmann a few moments ago you said that it showed great promise

You said that I can have the court reporter read it back to you Mr Bachmann

I dont need her to read it back to me I can remember

Nip Alert was poorly conceived and riddled with bugs wasnt it

Well all apps in the beginning

Mr Bachmann answer the question

You liked Nip Alert and it was terrible

No I I

Didnt you

Liking it

Mr Bachmann you liked it didnt you

Okay yes yes Fine Yes I liked it even though it was a terrible app and it had no market potential

I was high when he pitched it and I like nipples

Thank you Mr Bachmann

It was a buggy rapey piece of shit designed by an idiot

Mr Bachmann thank you very much

It was so bad that the first time that Richard tried to boot it up on his system it crashed his laptop It was in the shop for three days

Cause it was a piece of shit

clears throat

That

I mean among other things that werent that were reasons why it was bad

No more questions Your Honor

What the fuck is going on here

I dont know what happened He got in my head

Its a very uncharacteristic error

Theyre calling you next Richard

They want you on the stand in 10 minutes

Great So they figured it out

Were fucked arent we

It looks that way

Damn it theyre gonna ask me if I ran a test of Pied Piper on a Hooli computer and Im gonna have to say yes

What if you said no

What are you talking about

Are you saying I should lie on the stand or something

Gentlemen the less I know about this the better

Well then it appears were in good hands because you dont seem to know shit

Youre a mean and terrible attorney

Im not an attorney

Richard all they know is that you didnt have your laptop when you ran that test so just tell them that you borrowed my laptop or you came home for lunch and used my computer

Whatever you say Ill get back on the stand and then back you up

That would be committing perjury

That would be lying under oath

If you dont lie Richard you lose

We lose everything

The company 90 of what could potentially be a billion dollars

I mean you know because I have 10

I know God damn it I know

Richard do the right thing here

Lie on the stand

Mr Hendricks you are heterosexual yes

Uh yes

How long has it been since you were in a relationship with a woman Mr Hendricks

Two years Three

Uh yeah that sounds about right I guess

Youre under oath

Um longer

So youve definitely had no girlfriend in the past three years

This seems needlessly cruel We all get it

Mr Hendricks when you refer to a girlfriend in these emails to Mr Bighetti to what are you referring

My laptop computer

The same laptop that Mr Bachmann just told us was in a shop for three days from April 10th to the 12th of last year

Yes Can we get to the point please

Mr Hendricks did you at any time use a Hooli computer to test andor alter your Pied Piper algorithm

Youre under oath

I just

I just wanted to be different

I wanted Pied Piper to be different

But if this company is built on lies then were really not much different than Hooli

The law says that I lose everything

My whole company everything that I worked for

Because I used one Hooli computer to test and modify one block

Is that right

I mean is that Is that fair

To me if the system says thats fair then I guess Im probably not meant to be a part of it

Mr Hendricks please answer the question

Did you at any time use a Hooli computer

Yes Yeah I did

I made a mistake and I did

I used a Hooli computer to work on my algorithm one time

And so here you go

Its okay Richard You dont have to protect me anymore

Im his girlfriend

Sit down Mr Bachmann

Judge objection I was the one that was in the shop for those three days cause he had hit it so hard I needed a doctor

Judge Sit down Mr Bachmann

Dinesh Hey has anyone heard from Richard

Should I text him to see how the arbitrations going

Uh you can

But right now its going both well and poorly

And if you get definitive information back and its bad I could argue that you have effectively caused us to lose the arbitration

Oh hes taking it down

All right I am unclipped

If youre watching Im sorry

Im gonna go ahead and leave this egg here

This camera does need to come down

Thats good Hes leaving the egg

The bolts are all rusted out here

grunts

You should have never called that museum Jared

Theyre on there pretty good

screaming

Holy shit

Jared you just klled that guy

phone beeps

I just got a text from Richard

Im not gonna read it
