Russ clearing throat we need to pay our lawyers and we need to pay our engineers

So before you go can you just write us another check please

What No Richard giving you money right now is the worst thing I could do for you

What Why How

Look what just happened

I threatened to walk and you turned lean and hungry and you clawed your way into a 15million deal

And when you win this bakeoff because I gave you no money and I get my third comma back

I promise you this Richard

Im gonna come back here and you and I are gonna polish off this entire mtherfucking bottle of Tres Comas together

Put it right up high

Come on Dont leave me hanging

Thats it Thats how we do business

theme music plays



The Nucleus ad buy will be the largest in our history

Awareness of this product will be unprecedented

Yeah Am I the only one concerned about overexposure

Well we havent seen the platform yet but were planning on slipping Nucleus to influential tech journalists and bloggers

Because certainly once they see Nucleus

Sorry sorry That strategy just sounds so inside the box

Might it not be more innovative to shroud Nucleus in mystery until the official roll out next January

Gavin Im sorry

Is everything okay with Nucleus

We are on schedule yes

Because based on your assurances weve staked substantial resources on its performance

sighs

Gentlemen of the board and Rachel listen to me very carefully

Nucleus is on track

And you have my word that if it fails to be everything we need it to be someone will be held responsible

Me

You want me to come back to Hooli

No way Its too late

Ive accepted MITs offer of tenure

My wife my children and my mother are already back in Boston

Im here because I believe in you

And because I believe we didnt believe in you enough before

Yeah you did not

XYZ was beneath your talent

Surely you felt it I did

Why else would I lay it off on Bighetti

XYZ is about the distant future

But we cant wait for you We need you now guiding critical components of our core business

Components like Nucleus

Im sorry are you offering to put me in full charge of Nucleus

Indeed I am You and only you

Youll get the credit and the glory

The name Davis Bannerchek will be inextricably linked with that of Nucleus

I mean theres a chance no one will know I had anything to do with it at all

Gentlemen nothing else in the truck Stop

Who is done with transcode work flow Me

Good job Carla

Or should I say scrumptious

Because of the board the scrum board

Oh I get it

Yeah

Or just I mean not you

I mean you could You are

Uh Also thanks to everybody for forgoing your salary this week

Remember if we win bonuses all around so

Go team

When we win

scoffs

That is rousing Richard

Yeah so when we win it

computer chimes

Whoa Have you guys seen this

Seth the network security guy from EndFrame just changed his LinkedIn status to unemployed

No way

You think we got him fired

I bet we did

Thats awesome

Well we never actually breached his security

Remember we got Marcs login info and went through the front door So he didnt actually do anything wrong

He worked for EndFrame the pieces of shit that stole our algorithm

Yeah So by the transitive property he is therefore also a piece of shit

Well the pieces of shit fired him

So his piece of shit status is reversed

Okay fine So the transitive property may no longer apply but the reflexive property states everythings equal to itself

So since hes a piece of shit hes a piece of shit

Okay math aside the point Im trying to make here is we didnt actually break his code Okay

So hes getting fired for no reason

And I kinda feel bad for the guy

Hes probably pulling his hair out somewhere wondering where he screwed up

But he didnt screw up and hell never know that for the rest of his life

I bet youre right

He probably is just ripping his hair out somewhere

I wish I could see that

Piece of shit

Hes a piece of shit

Erlich Monica

Did you forget JianYang eyes pitch

No I was on my phone

You talking to Benson or Hedges

chuckles Am I right Cigarette company

Clever

What if I told you there is an app on the market

Not now No you wait until youre inside Okay

We havent even gotten the bottle of water yet

Head in Ill meet you in there I just need to finish this call

Sure Cool with a K

 

Okay

Water

What if I told you there is an app

JianYang this is the assistant

We wait for the boss to pitch

The woman you saw outside Okay

The lady who was smoking You said no

Sorry sorry Monica was smoking

Cigarettes

Cigarettes

No no no Hes confused

Hes Chinese

Hes talking about this crackaddict prostitute we saw at the gas station She was smoking cigarettes

So sad

Oh

JianYang whatre you doing This is Palo Alto

People are lunatics about smoking here

We dont enjoy all the freedoms that you have in China

All right Where people smoke all the time

I dont smoke

Except for special occasions

So you do smoke

Wait have you been smoking in my house

No Theres no special occasion ever happen in your house

 

See this little bald spot on my temple

Ive literally been tearing my own hair out

I emailed Gilfoyle about a dozen times and all he kept sending me were these photos

Some woman choking Balls

Choking A pair of balls I I get it

Choke on my balls Its like a rebus

Hes such a dick

How the fuck did he get into my system

At least give me a hint

Something Anything

fuck

What if hypothetically uh there was a certain CEO in your office that left his login information on a Postit and a certain someone took it and used that to get in

Are you saying Gilfoyle never penetrated my network

Im saying you werent fired because of anything to do with your security config

It wasnt my fault

Oh my God You know what

Im glad I came here

I think its good just to get everything out in the open

That piece of shit

Gilfoyle kept taunting me and taunting me

Whatre you doing No

Hello Gilfoyle

Dont call him

Its Seth

Dont mention me or

Richard just told me about the Postit So fuck you

You just fucked with the wrong hacker

Theres theres kids

Im gonna skullfuck your whole system

fuck you Gilfoyle

fuck you Richard

fuck all of you Pied Piper fucks

I actually dont I dont know him

Im just here by myself

Just watching and waiting

I love kids Not like that

So

Why would do that Why would you go talk to him

I dont know you know

Facetoface meetings make things better

I just felt bad for the guy and he was not doing well

I mean what if I hadnt said anything and hed have you know klled himself

Yeah well theres no chance of that now is there

Richard you dont seem to understand whats going on

We hacked into EndFrames system and stole their specs

You cant go traipsing around to their former employees telling them how we did it just to make them feel better

Youre a fucking black hat now Act like it

What Im a black hat How am I a black hat

EndFrame stole from us first

And since the negative of a negative is a positive stealing from a thief is okay

Its the additive inverse property

Math aside Richard were all black hats now

The point is what are we gonna do about Seth

How do you mean

Well I mean we have an unemployed and very pissed off systems guy who very publicly threatened to skullfuck our whole system

Hes not gonna do shit

Hes a coder

By definition were all pussies

Look hell vent for half an hour and then hell go LARPing and mogging and stroke his dick for a while

Even if he does try to crack us Richard I built our network security myself

Im not worried about it at all

So just

This doesnt concern you guys

Okay because he said and I quote that he was going to skullfuck us

Oh hey Hi

You have a great daughter

Come on Ashley lets go

phone rings

Go for Erlich

Thanks for outing me

Youre gay

That explains so much

No outing me for smoking

I was heading home when my insane boss called me into the conference room for some kind of antismoking intervention

No one ever died from secondhand hero1n

Yeah she said that

What did you say

I said nothing

JianYang may have let a little something slip to your boy Friday but dont worry I covered with aplomb

That little weasel tells Laurie everything

On that topic what did you think of his app

The fundamental idea is sound

An app that helps parents find the least crowded playgrounds

Good So you understood him

The problem is hes basically created the perfect tool for pedophiles to find victims

Yes and pedophiles are typically not earlyadopters so we would miss out on that whole market

Thats problematic

Well well tweak it when we present it to your boss

I dont think what I saw was close to ready for Laurie

Oh really Monica Im sorry that your boss unearthed your filthy little secret but believe it or not I actually tried to have your back and I was hoping you might do the same for me

Then again your judgment is suspect

You are a smoker

I smoke a few cigarettes a week

coughing

Fine Ill ask Laurie for five minutes but thats it

And tell JianYang he better bring it

Monica we may never know what indecipherable Chinese province JianYang comes from but I know this much JianYang was born to bring it and you have got to try women

I mean just give it a chan

Im sure the work that you have done so far has been very good

But now that I am here the real work begins and time is of the essence




    push

Im gonna need status reports from every department

Where are we

We have a mobile beta on a HooliPhone

You wanna see it

Mmm Yeah

He quit

What do you mean he quit

According to security he entered the building at 913

He met with the Nucleus team for 11 minutes

Then he used his key card to exit the building

Three minutes later he was clocked at 73 in a 25 zone going past our daycare center

He never returned and he hasnt responded to our calls or email

Gavin is it possible that this is a good thing

Bannerchek was gonna step in at the last minute and take a lot of the credit for Nucleus

Now the world will know that youre responsible for Nucleus

You and you alone

sighs

Not now

Okay so no attempts to externally access the system

Right No SQLi XSS worms Trojans nothing

Same answer as I gave you the last three days No

Seth hasnt done shit Were all good

Richard your paranoia has become officially tedious

Okay okay Our platform is basically built

Tomorrow Intersite is gonna start dumping 100 terabytes of video directly onto our server via fucking FTP

We are gonna be the most vulnerable weve ever been

And Seth is out there lurking Just lurking in the darknet ready to pounce like an Internet panther And we dont care

Okay well frankly your lack of paranoia is insane to me

Now youre paranoid that were not paranoid enough

Youre paraparanoid Richard

Where are you going

To the kitchen

Why are you going together Are you gonna talk about me

Whatre you looking at

You guys have got a lot of work to do

Im glad you reached out

And I want you to know Im not gonna do any of those things that I threatened to do

Really Just to be clear no skullfucking of any kind

No I guess I just needed to vent

Actually I was pretty worried that your were gonna do something crazy

You can relax

And please tell Gilfoyle Im sorry for what I said and that he can relax too

Oh you dont have to worry about Gilfoyle

He couldnt have cared less

Really

Yeah You know I gotta I gotta be honest

I mean Im really glad I came back here

I mean Dinesh and Gilfoyle obviously said it was a bad idea especially given what happened

But this just really restores my faith that facetoface meetings are the way to

That smug cocksucker didnt think I had the skills to break into his system that mtherfucker

What What are you Dont Who are you calling

Hello Gilfoyle Its Seth again

Hey dont mention that I Richard here just told me youre not afraid of me

Well you know what Im gonna do to you now mtherfucker

Get out our here Scatter Scatter

Im skullfucking the shit out of your system this time

How you like me now you cocksucking mtherfucking piece of shit

In our initial build we realized that the same geotagging technology that could be used to locate uncrowded playgrounds could also be used to prey on children our greatest natural resource by one of societys worst elements

Pedophiles

The pedophile facing nature of the app would present marketing pain points Yes

But under Monicas guidance we realized the same technology could also be used to create a realtime crowdsourced map of an even worse segment of the population

Worse than pedophiles

Smokers

Because lets face it no ones ever died of secondhand hero1n

True True

With our app users can locate and thus avoid these selfindulgent selfdestructive negligent monsters

Negligent Yeah

We call it Smokation

Its a clever hybrid of smoker and location

Its interesting

Its interesting

Well done Well done

So what kind of term sheet do you think shes gonna lay on us

Theres a lot of work to do but you certainly knew how to play to your audience

So Id say it looks good

Oh today is a great day

What is he doing

Special occasion

Oh shit

You brought cigarettes in here

No I take from her purse

Richard Well this is it

Our pants are basically around our ankles until this transfer is done

Anything

Again no Nothing

Well did you sweep for

Unauthorized kernel modules yes

I even purged the entire server hypervisor again

I know we are vulnerable right now but Richard were covered okay

We severed the prod and dev net

Look you made us put our phones in a fucking Faraday cage

We even klled the WiFi and reverted back to this stone age hard line Ethernet switch

Look at all this shit Are we in the 90s

Richard no one is cracking our transfer

Not Seth not some rogue nuclear state not Sk3wl of fucking R00t

No one

And in two hours and 47 minutes when weve pulled all of Intersites data onto our servers were golden

So just chill the fuck out

Do another Weissman test to make yourself feel better

I just did

Still at 51

Actually 52

Holy shit dude Thats blazing

Wait so were actually gonna win this thing

I dont know Ask me again in two hours and 46 minutes

Russ Hey quit all the fucking and let me in

Hey come on whys the door locked

Coming

Are you afraid youre gonna get rped

Jared dont

What Youre locking the door now

You dont answer my texts What the fuck

Russ were at a pretty critical juncture right now so

Whats that

That is Prngrphy thousands of hours of it

Yeah it is

Russ tomorrow I would be happy to walk this through with you

Okay Im out of here Just answer me this are we good

Yes The platform is running great

But its just really fragile right now and we have a lot to focus on

So again probably tomorrow would be

Fine fine After we have tequila

Uh

What

Shots boys

Im in

No no ones in

What are Were not doing shots right now Russ

Richard come on quit being such a pssy and have some tequila with your money guy

Youre not our money guy

Im not your money guy

Since when

Since you stopped giving us money asshole

Whos an asshole I forced you to get lean

No You forced us to hack EndFrame and break the law

And now like it or not Im a fucking black hat

But thats okay Thats okay Thats cool

Were gonna win this bakeoff and pay you enough money to go away forever

So take your shitty tequila and your shitty jeans with fucking metal chunks on them and get the fuck out of here

Wow thats Thats harsh

First of all this is not shitty tequila This is very good tequila

400yearold familyrun distillery

Super highend shit

But I guess what really bums me out is I thought we got each other

You know you were my guys you know

That guy

Bin Laden

He fucks

You know whats hard about being a billionaire Richard

You never know if someone likes you for you or for your money

And I guess with you it was all about the money wasnt it Richard

Dont you worry Ill leave and Ill even leave you the tequila because thats who I am But before I go I want you to come outside and see something Its a gift

Come on outside everybody Just I wont waste your time

Just for a second

No way

A McLaren 650S Spider

Billion

What do you think Richard You like it

Wow I

I dont know what to say

You got this for me

What

No I Its for me I bought this for myself to celebrate you guys helping me get back to a billion

Thats why I came here to show it to you To say thank you

Im not an asshole

You drove here with a bow on it

No I put it on after I parked

I dont understand

You got yourself a gift to prove that youre not an asshole

Right

phone ringing

Um sorry

Hello

This is Eshwar Singh the CTO of Intersite

What the fuck are you doing Youre deleting all my data

What the hell What the hell

fuck Im locked out of the system

So am I

We all are

Its just deleting everything

You mtherfuckers

Its fucking Seth Gilfoyle you said you had this

I thought I did I dont This is fucking impossible

Eshwar You guys are killing me

Im losing hundreds of hours of content

Yeah well we got hacked So pull the plug Shut it down on your end

I cant The disc is spinning at 100 and I dont have access

Now its basically a fucking fork bmb and you locked me out of my own system

Okay uh Carla shut it down

None of the system shortcuts are responding

Cant even SIGKILL the transfer

Its like all of our keyboards are locked

Okay fucking Eshwar I cant really problem solve this and talk to you on the phone at the same time so

Dont you dare fucking hang up on

How the fuck did Seth do this

Well you said he was harmless

Obviously I was wrong He must be inside as root

Its like hes right here in this house melting us down

Can you guys just shut the fuck up Im trying to sleep

Why the fuck would you smoke immediately after an antismoking pitch

Why would you do that Why

Its a special occasion

Go to your room fuck

Seth is singlehandedly fucking the future of this company and theres nothing we can do about it

Make it stop Make it stop Make it stop

It just stopped deleting

Hey guys

I think its this

What the fuck

Its happening again

No no no Dont do that

Take it off Take it off

laughs

The Tres Comas bottle was on the delete key

It was

The corner of it

It was just It just got on there

Thats not great

But good now Here you go

Im gonna

I gotta go

Did we delete over 9000 hours of your premium content

Yes we did

And that is bad certainly

But the way we did it

See our compression is so incredibly powerful that we were able to delete all those files at a rate that until now was unthinkable if were considering just raw speed

Uh

So uh just bear in mind you know when making your final decision had EndFrame uh accidentally put a tequila bottle on their delete key I guarantee they would have struggled to delete half the amount of files that we did

At best

Or worst

I could also

I could uh I

Worst

Definitely

Yeah

Um

But you know what

Um I

I uh Im actually glad that we came here today all of us because this is good

Because now more than ever in these times meeting facetoface

Get out

All of All of us or just

Now All of you

Okay

Thank you for your time

I would be remiss if I didnt mention that your sites are some of my primary destinations

Out

Okay
