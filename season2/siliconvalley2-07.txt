chuckles

They should be out shortly

Would you guys like some water while you wait

We have four flavors and the cartons are made from locally sourced organic

Yeah we get it Youre funded so

Theyre good

sighs

The market has been exceptionally volatile lately

As a result many of the very aggressive positions we took at your specific request have performed poorly

Very very poorly

Do you understand

Yeah Would you fuck her

If I werent married I suppose but Russ as your business manager I need to tell you something and youre not going to like it

At all

 

Dinesh So whats the plan here Richard

Were not gonna like fight them right

Uh No no I dont I just

I mean we got to do something

Even if its just yelling at them telling them that theyre not gonna get away with this

But you know they are right

Well not if I have anything to do about it

But you sort of dont

I support you Richard no matter how futile the effort

Thanks

Look who just rightswiped me on Tinder

Wow

Huh Um

Friend

What friend You dont have any friends

Maroush Davidson Jones

Okay fine Fine You got me

A couple of weeks back I went on a few interviews okay

And Yoyodyne was one of them

Jesus Back off

Outed by WiFi

It was when you said you were selling to Hooli and you know as soon as you went with Russ I blew them off

You know what fuck this

Im not waiting anymore Im going in there

Mr Bachmans walking back to you now

Thats not my name My name is Richard Hendricks

Hey remember us

Oh Hey guys Whats up

 

You know what you did

Okay I saw your live stream

Okay I saw your algorithm

Thats mine You stole it

Stole We asked you guys some questions a while back and you were very helpful

See Look These the photos These are the photos

This is proof that you stole it from us

No those photos prove that you gave it to us

Well youre stealing it all wrong

I mean this is how youre gonna build the code book

Honestly This is bushleague

And look at all these redundancies

I mean look if youre gonna build it like that

Erlich Richard no

Dinesh Richard

Ugh

Hey pen down Dumbledorf

Suffice to say there is something somewhere on this board that is gonna strangle you at scale

Dont write that down Stop

Hear me when I say this

Your tech is always gonna be worse than ours

Thats fine

How is that fine

Cause we have a finished platform and you dont

Which means were the only middleout company currently in the marketplace

And thats enough for my sales team

Your what

phones ringing

This is our sales team

indistinct chatter

Okay

phones continue ringing

Hear that sound buddy

Thats the sound of us leaving you in the dust

music theme playing

Gentlemen of the Hooli board and lady question what is failure

To the ignorant or those in conventional industries the recent Nucleus glitch may seem a failure purely in the negative sense

But we in this valley all know that failures just like this one are really stepping stones

To bring us the iPhone Steve Jobs first had to bring us the Newton

To bring us Facebook

Mark Zuckerberg also had to bring us Wirehog

Before he brought us Digg Kevin Rose had to bring us a whole lot of useless things and after Digg as well for that matter

The point being what those in dying business sectors call failure we in tech know to be pregreatness

Uh Im sorry

Are you telling us that the disastrous results of your Nucleus live stream are a good thing

No Im not telling you that

History is telling you that

Please Gavin enough spin

A misstep of that magnitude theres no excuse

Its not like we can tell the shareholders youve suddenly added new functionality

Havent I

Have you

We werent told about this

If I told you about it it wouldnt exactly be a secret function

Now would it

Secret function

Are you saying youve added something new to the Nucleus platform

Imagine if you will a function so gamechanging that its integration into Nucleus will justify any miscue in the platforms roll out

Imagine if you will a function so gamechanging that its integration into Nucleus will justify any miscue in the platforms roll out

Seriously imagine it and do it quickly

You were all brought here to generate moonshots

I need a moonshot now

If theres any greatness in any of you at all now is the time to access it

Please dont disappoint me

Please please please dont disappoint me

Maybe start after lunch

Yeah

Yeah

 

Hello Russ

Oh my God Is that shit

Oh

Is there dog shit on the floor

Yes its shit

God

What happened to your painting

Thats what I wanted to talk to you about

Ive got some bad news and youre gonna hear it eventually so you might as well hear it from me

Sit down

My accountant has informed me that uh

Im financially ruined

Holy shit How

Because of a series of bad investments that my fucking money guy let me talk him into Ive managed to lose over 200 million

Wait Didnt you start out with 12 billion

I mean youre not exactly broke right

I might as well be

986 million

Im not a billionaire anymore Richard

Im a ninehundred andeightysixionaire which isnt even a fucking thing

Im out of the Three Comma Club

Functionally Im just like you

Jesus fuck thats depressing

Right But youre still basically a billionaire

Not if you round down

If you round down I have zero billion

Forbes has taken me off their billionaires list

Instead theyll probably put me on their closebutnocigar list which is ironic because I smoke a fuck ton of cigars

Why the fuck do I buy so many cigars

I remember the second I became a billionaire

I was assnaked sitting right there just clicking and refreshing clicking and refreshing watching my stock rise And when it happened I popped a rod so fast I went blind for a full minute

Nutted all over those cushions

I was the king

Now look at me

Two shitty fucking commas

I had to sell my McLaren

Yeah but theres a Maserati in the driveway

Who gives a fuck

That has doors that open like this

Not like this

Or like this

So its all fucked

Well its not all fucked

You did save 50000 not paying for the charity ball tickets that you gave me

Quite an embarrassing moment for JianYang and I

What Richard listen my accountants tell me

I need you to start throwing off cash as quickly as possible okay

But you said generating revenue was exactly what we shouldnt be doing

But now that Im spelling billion with an M

Im saying do the exact opposite

I need you to come back to me in 24 hours and bring me a proposal that turns the entire operation into a salesbased model just like you told me those assholes over at EndFrame have

Youre gonna dig me out of this hole Richard

What

You said it yourself

EndFrame is built to grab a bunch of cash quickly and thats what I need

Uh

Dad where is Mom

Your mom is with her friend Philippe

Theyre in Napa Shes gonna be a few hours

These guys are gonna watch you okay

Watch out for the dog shit Okay

I gotta hit the road

Daddys going to Vegas

Flying in a rented Citation Ultra

fuck me

Hello

Erlich Uh hey buddy

Jared Russ wants us to convert to a sales model

Thats just not possible

I mean you saw the size of that team at EndFrame

There were 40 people in that room

Right

Even if we fired all of the engineers that we just hired

Looking good

Keep at it Claude

Jared Absolutely Your jobs are not at risk

Thats very comforting

Even if we adjusted our workforce and hired sales people instead Service Level Agreements like that are enormously complex they take a huge number of man hours

Theres no way we could find clients negotiate terms and push deals out the funnel fast enough to yield real cash anytime soon

Were just not built for it

Right Yeah Yeah

Oh Karen posted another photo

Sending it to you right now

Wait Why does it say sent from my iPhone at the bottom

You just sent this from your computer

Its so that I seem like Im an outandabout kind of person

I put that in the signature and then in the body Ill write fun stuff like Im at the opening of a secret restaurant

Or Im watching Jaws at the pool of an old hotel

You know keep it fun vague mysterious

It is a mystery why you think youll ever see a woman naked

Dinesh do you want a piece of advice

No thank you

Okay I

I know Karen is out of my league

Okay Shes practically not my species

Im a guppy and Im trying to mate with a dolphin

You guys are bottomfeeders

Youre like the fish that swim into other fishs mouths and eat bacteria off their teeth

Theres no such fish You made that fish up

Okay its an analogy

Im not gonna debate the existence of the literal fish with you cause its not relevant

Well good cause it doesnt exist

That is a real fish

Why dont you just send emails from your actual iPhone

Its all the way in my room

Wait so you are trying to convince this girl that you run halfmarathons but you wont walk halfway across this house to get your iPhone

Basically

 

Hi Is there a a Russ

mumbling

Boy genius whats up

Hey Russ uh

Look Ive run the numbers 50 different ways and I just dont know how Im gonna convert

You dont need to know I dont pay you to know

Know what

Thats right I know you dont know

I dont know what you know

No you dont know cause I figured it out

You know what Its what I do

I put radio on the Internet

Im putting the third comma back into my net worth and you dont have to do jack shit

Thanks Come on lets get some food Im starving

Do you want your

Richard hey

Good to see you again

What is this

This is the solution

Theyre not a competitor if youre a part of them right

Pied Piper is gonna merge with EndFrame

I mean seriously Im a genius right

Whoa whoa whoa Where the fuck are you going

Youre gonna blow this deal

You cannot be serious

Those are the guys who ripped off my algorithm which they totally fucked up by the way

Okay so now you can fix it

YYou give them a better algorithm theyll give you a killer sales team

And in exchange for bringing you to them they give me a big fat buyout of my stake in your company

Im that much closer to rebillionizing

Those guys are clowns

Clowns with commitments worth millions

Did you know they have a deal on the table with Intersite

Intersite The prn company Really

I know Awesome right

And theyve done months of hard work

All you have to do is show up and compress shit

The answer is no

Wrong You do this deal or I pull your funding

Well you cant pull funding because we have a contract so

Oh we have a contract

We have a fucking contract Richard

You wanna know what I have

chiming on and off

A fucking car whose doors open like this

Not like this not like this

engine starting

stereo playing loudly

These are not the doors of a billionaire Richard

fuck you

engine roaring tires screeching

fuck you in the ass




    push

electric guitar playing

So you wanna sue Russ Hanneman

Yeah Yeah we had a contract

He promised to give us 5 million and now hes welshing

And you wanna sue EndFrame

Yes because they stole our IP

Before or after you gave it to em

Okay we were tricked so

Richie youre not a guy that should be worried about suing people

You need to be worried about the guy at Hooli whos suing you

If you dont mount a vigorous legal defense then you lose to Gavin Belson by default

And you are stamped Property of Hooli

You let Hanneman walk how you plan on paying these cats

I just paid them 80 grand

As a retainer

That retains them

Now you gotta pay them

Hold on So I just paid them 80000 for the right to pay them more

Yeah

fucking lawyers man Right

Like it or not Richie youre stuck with Hanneman

 

Monica I mean technically its not even a merger

EndFrame just absorbs you and youre gone

Right So basically we end up working for EndFrame after giving them our idea which was way better than theirs and they end up making more money than us

fuck that Assholes

fucking kingsized assholes

Buttholes indeed

What if we didnt do that

What if instead we got our own client like EndFrame has a prn company or something

Thats not really how it works Gilfoyle

You cant just go get a client

Why not

Cause its not that easy

Why not

Cause EndFrame worked that Intersite deal for months kicking every detail of the contract and SLA back and forth promising tons of custom features

And you cant just make that stuff up

What if I didnt have to make it up

What if I had every detail of their deal on my computer right in front of me

Im sorry um

Are you just asking what if or do you actually have this information

Gilfoyle please dont tell me that you hacked into EndFrames system

Okay I wont tell you that

WWell did you hack into it or not

My feeling is if youre the CEO of a company and youre dumb enough to leave your login info on a Postit note on your desk while the people that you fucking ripped off are physically in your office its not a hack

Its barely social engineering

Its more like natural selection

fucking ninja

Okay I was not in the room while this was happening

This is way over the line

This is crazy illegal

Were not trading on stolen information Its not worth it

What if it was worth it

Its not so

Gilfoyle uh hypothetically how much is it worth

15 million

What

Holy shit

Okay I was definitely not in the room while this happened

Ive got it all right here with a bow on it

Delivery dates benchmarks

Theyre promising to deliver highquality 4K streaming video at 20 megabits per second

Thats it Thats dog shit

If we can put a halfdecent build of our platform in front of Intersite I mean we can shark this 15 mil right out from under EndFrame

I I dont understand

How does Intersite have all this money to throw around

Its Prngrphy Richard

Adult content has driven more important tech adaption than anything

The first fiction ever published on a printing press was an erotic tale

And from there it was Super 8 film

Polaroid home video digital video on demand

Monica Credit card verification systems Snapchat

Prngrphy accounts for 37 of all Internet traffic

38 when Im on it

Reducing Intersite server load by a tiny fraction could save them tens of millions of dollars a year

Hundreds

15 million is only like six hours of Intersite CDN bill right

But to us that

I mean we could settle out with Russ pay our legal fees have plenty of runway to get us to CES

Minor detail This is stealing

You mean like lying and telling someone that you want to fund their company and then taking their tech when they meet with you

Like that kind of stealing

You wanted to do something Richard

This is something

 

Its time to walk the lefthand path Richard

 

The statistics here are clear

Protecting existing revenue streams in the current climate is no longer a viable option

We must run forward simply to stay in place by doing what the adult industry has always done lead

Pioneering cuttingedge interfaces across new device platforms like Oculus and iWhack will be the key to our survival as an industry

And based on their recent investment patterns tech leaders such as Facebook agree

Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the future

Erlich What is that on your computer screen A fractal

No its just pictures of art Ive been sending Karen from my mobile phone which is charging over there

I told her I just got back from a gallery opening in Hunters Point

Who painted that disappointment

Jaden age five

I got it from his Montessori school website

Hes not online hes never gonna find out

What

Crimes against children

Really so easy to get away with

cell phone chimes

Oh another text from Karen

In your hood Can I come over

IDK Too soon question mark

fuck

Whats the issue

This is what you want

You know its The place is so dirty right now

Probably another day is best for such activity

Um should I tell her Im out getting Ethiopian tapas

I dont see what the problem is here

She wants to come over and she acknowledged that its too soon

Youve basically done the deed which for you is ejaculating in your own pants all over your leg and then apologizing profusely

Just maintain eye contact light some scented candles and throw in some Sade

The early stuff though before her arrangements got too baroque

Okay that is sad

I can do this Um

She would never sleep with a guy who lives like this

I dont even know where to start

Um do you guys want to help me clean up a little bit real quick

No dont do that

Uh Miss Kendall

Yeah

Excuse me

I am data compression

I do data compression and uh I know that um EndFrame is telling you that they can lower your bandwidth and storage costs by delivering your new 4K video stream at 20 megabits per second

Who the hell are you

Uh sorry Im Pied Piper

I am Richard Hendricks of

Youre the CEO

Yes

Uh thank you

I saw you at TechCrunch

How do you know the specs of my EndFrame deal

I cant I dont

Okay I dont like this at all Richard Hendricks

Im sorry Goodbye

I can save you millions in bandwidth

My uh algorithm is lossless

I can deliver the same 4K video at seven megabits per second 60 fps

We are faster and have a higher quality than EndFrame at a third of the bit rate

Bullshit

I can prove it

Before you spend a dime let me prove it

You know Im on the board of two charities and a nokill animal shelter with Gavin Belson right

The man who is suing you for stealing his IP

That lawsuits bullshit

I have a very complicated deal in place with EndFrame

Why should I back out and take a risk on you

Back there you said that your business needs to do whatever it takes in order to survive

Well so does mine

And this is it

If I dont get this deal my company is dead

So this is your place

Yes

I know its weird that a guy like me would live here but honestly this is just where I rest

Out there is where I live

Did you get my link to the Catalan animation festival

Oh did I

Where do you stand on the subtitling v dubbing debate

Cause to me dubbing is boorish

Cause every language to me has its own

Hey howd you get on our WiFi

How does your phone know the password

Did it

Yeah it connected immediately

Its an alphanumeric

Oh

Long password

Oh

Um I

Okay this is really weird

Karen

Erlich

Hey

I didnt realize that it was you Karen the Karen that Dinesh

You two know each other

In a sense Yeah

What

Outed by WiFi

Is the specifics of the sense

Oh uh

You never uh you never called

I uh got super busy

Hey we all do

Well we should probably head to the festival so

So did you ever find my earrings

I I dont know

Should we uh check the old lost and found

Okay

 

So here goes

By wearing this standard Hooli earbud headphone modified with a small piezoelectric sensor the user can control their Hooli phone solely with their neural impulses

Point click drag even type all using only brainwaves

Think it and it happens

Holy shit

Seriously

Seriously

This is great

fuck yes team

So uh whats our um timeline here

I mean when do we start testing this

How long before we can integrate this into Nucleus

Not long

Itll probably happen in our lifetime

We just have to figure out how to make it work chuckles

But I really believe that our grandchildren are going to grow up taking this technology for granted

Our grandchildren

I know youre single but you might meet someone

No No No

What do you have thats ready now

Well Hmm

Truth be told we kind of put all our eggs into this basket but we do have the kickass potato cannon though

Although actually this one is broken

We tried to put a Mr Potato Head in it and it did not like that

 You give me youre giving me 
 The sweetest taboo 
 Too good for me 

Still in there eh

What do you think Will they ever find those earrings

Funny thing about lost items always in the last place you look

 

Thanks for coming in guys

I look forward to working with you

Us too

Come on back This way

Were right in here

Oh hey Mark

Good to see you again

What is this

This is a bake off

Im gonna give EndFrame and Pied Piper the same video library to compress

In a week Ill review and award the contract to whoever does a better job

What

Who whomever

What

Whomever does the better But okay yeah Never mind

Welcome to the lefthand path my friend
