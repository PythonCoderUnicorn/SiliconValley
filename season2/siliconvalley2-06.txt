applause

Pardon me is that seat taken

laughs Oh Gavin

Man Classic Gavin

Lets hope this sucks

Oh good Monica made it just in time

Carla looks like you wont be the only woman in the house for a change

Christ One thing worse than being the only woman in a company is being one of only two

Whys that

Everybody puts this superweird pressure on you to be friends

Its creepy

Hey did I miss it

No

Good

Monica Id like to introduce you to Carla

Carla Monica

Monica Carla

Whats up

Nice to meet you

I knew you two would hit it off

Hey Monica

Its starting

Announcer Tonight for the first time ever streaming live in 4K resolution over the internet UFC Fight Night powered by Nucleus

No networks No more middleman No bullshit

Were bringing the fights straight to the fans

Were cutting the cord forever with UFC Fight Pass powered by Nucleus

Tonight youll get ultimate fighting at the ultimate resolution

Nucleus puts 4K UHD video in a lossless compression chokehold and forces the competition to tap out

grunts

glass shattering

Oh laughs

What a Douchebag He sure likes to break stuff

Announcer We are live in Las Vegas

The picture looks amazing

Announcer Man Joe this is a fight weve been looking forward to for a long long time

Are we getting a contact high off Erlich or is the edge starting to warble

No I see it Are they converting down to 24 frames

Announcer The defense so far Wow

The jerkiness is not a Nucleus issue right

I mean its not going out to the world like that is it

I think it looks great

You see that frame judder as the camera pans

The pictures so blocky It looks like Minecraft

It doesnt make sense its supposed to be totally lossless

Let me dump their bit stream to disk and take a look

Shes really smart

But not afraid to be bawdy

Oh my God

They are so fucked

Yeah this is bad

crowd cheering

Announcer Attack with the left

Hes hurt Hes down

Hes hit Oh

Its frozen

Its frozen

Announcer It is all over

Unbelievable

I have never in all my years of watching fighting seen a finishing combination more ferocious

What a spectacular finish by Molina

Were being told that the Nucleus live stream

fuck

may have cut out during that exchange

If that is true what a travesty

Gavin fuck

theme song plays

Gavin Belson just shit everyones pants

He sure did The encoding is totally underpowered to cover up their defects

Nucleus just cant keep up with 4K live stream yet

Hey Could Pied Piper handle live 4K video

I could deploy a live video stream that would be way better than theirs right now

Jump on it Now Like do our own live stream

Partner with someone like Gavin did

Look at you two

Hold on Live streamings not really our primary business here

Yeah but beating Nucleus is The blogs would go nuts

Were built for it on my end

If its just me hosting seeds and manifests Im good on my end

Im prepared to brag about it and release publicity

Well peertopeer delivery is good to go here Let me know

Oh Carla do you want to show Monica your work station

No thanks

laughs

Okay but Hooli had a deal with UFC that would stream a fight

What do we even do Dont really have a lot of time here

Thats real

We could find an event thats already in motion

Can I make a suggestion There is a nesting pair of California condors on the closedcircuit feed at the Natural History Museum

Theres an egg in the nest right now Its very compelling

Why dont we just live stream me killing you

I wouldnt be so dismissive There was a live stream of an eagles nest last year that went viral and was getting millions of hits

And I dont wanna be inflammatory but next to a condor an eagle looks like a common cackling

fuck that Jared Ive got it

Im very good friends with Aaron Anderson

DoubleA The guy who owns Homicide Energy Drink

Uh is Homicide the extra douchey energy drink

It sure is Theres a bunch of stunts and crazy shit on here

The video player quality is terrible Its a perfect candidate

And DoubleA loves me Hed definitely hook us up

How do you know him

From college He was a sophomore when I was a senior

He and his roommates used to live down the hall

I used to party in their room all the time

Uh kind of a mentormentee sort of thing

Coming from a manatee sort of thing

You look like a ferret that gave up on himself six months ago Gilfoyle

Im going to ping DoubleA

Wait

What if he says yes You know

Are we really gonna drop everything to do this

What if we dont get it right

I mean it could hurt us just like it hurt them

Shit I dont know

This is critical Richard Maybe we should SWOT this decision

I dont know what that is but no

SWOT analysis

No

SWOT No

Holy cow

Did he really just say holy cow

Ive had a board ready for just such an occasion

Ive boobytrapped the house with corporate resources

SWOT is a way of evaluating a decision

And you just break it down into strengths

weaknesses opportunities and threats

Youre fucking joking

Not at all

You can SWOT a concept a department or a new initiative

You can even SWOT a person although you have to be careful

They might SWOT you back

I wanna SWOT you

Well you can

Because now you have the tools

Okay Um shout them out and Ill tack them up

Jared Im really sorry but I I have to go

You know would it make more sense if I worked something up and then I got back to you guys

And okay great Im on it

People love condors

Strengths

Man On top of the roof Blaine is gonna launch off this ramp

Its pretty gnarly

Everything goes right hell fly over this street and land on this 15story building here

Weve got 27 cameras a couple in the car

Feed a live edit back here to the data center

We put everything through your incredible compression Richard and up onto the web

So what do you think Richard

I think this is awesome DoubleA

I mean it is incredible

You really have built a giant monument to awesomeness

I think my aid in helping you achieve this is what inspired me to start my own incubator

Uh so Richard you ready for this

Oh yeah I think so Yeah uh

DoubleA we are psyched

And uh we can do whatever you need

Okay thanks KoolAid

KoolAid Whats that Are you KoolAid

Yeah its just a term of endearment

You know nickname I used to rock it back in the day cause I was cool and supportive

Yeah Oh hey guys this is Gina shes one of our event managers

Hey uh Gina can you take Dinesh and Gilfoyle to the data center please

Sure You wanna follow me

Only if we get hats Gina

You can just take mine

Did you see that She gave me her hat

Pretend youve seen a woman before

Are those Homicide drinks for free

Yeah Knock yourself out

Homicide

Is there any way that it could be maybe more like just

You and me talking and not Erlich

What do you mean Arent you guys friends I thought you go way back

We do But

To be honest I could never stand the guy

I mean just hearing his voice again is giving me PTSD

Right But you just called him cool

No I called him KoolAid We all did

Right

Because hes like the KoolAid pitcher from the ads

As in every fucking time we were hanging out without him hed come smashing through a wall

But you still hung out with him

Yeah cause we were 19 and he had weed and beer

But even drunk and high I couldnt take it

I mean its like hes fucking allergic to letting other people talk

Its like hes always gotta say something You know

Erlich Hey Richard

Homicide

laughs

So Dinesh I have a question Youre obviously Pakistani but the name Dinesh is Indian isnt it

Yeah Wow thats exactly right

You know most people ignorant people dont even know those are two separate countries

And they dont care either

How do you know about my name

Im an Army brat My dad was stationed in Karachi when I was a kid

It was a beautiful place Full of beautiful people

Kind of like this room right

laughs Oh hold on a sec Ill be right back

Oh dont take too long

Ew

This is awesome I dont know if its whats in this but I have like all these killer lines coming to me

Im on fucking fire right now Oh She likes me right

Yeah shes totally into you

Just not as into you as she is into that guys mouth

Hes definitely gonna fuck her later and shes not gonna think of you while its happening

gddmn it fuck

Now Im just shaking What do they put in this shit

Milk thistle

Hey guys Come out here

Juliet calls

Guys this is Blaine Hes the guy doing the stunt

Blaine these are the genius coders who are helping us with the live stream

Theyre rock stars

Okay

So this is the car youre jumping

Yes it is

And thats what your ramps gonna look like

Yeah

Cool Well have you

Yeah and because I know that youre gonna ask yes Ive done this before And yes its fucking dangerous

Listen I got a lot of work to do to get this right

Okay

Okay

Hey you see what I saw

Yes uh hes got the velocity calculated wrong

Its for a flat plane

He doesnt account for the curve in the ramp

Exactly Hes probably used to doing straight ramps

I mean the chart says hes gonna launch at 81 miles per hour but its going to be more like  Under 70

The downforce is ridiculous

Hes gonna lose speed and hit the side of that wall

And die So we should probably

Okay All right

Hey uh Blaine

One small thing

Blaine No

Im gonna stop you right there Glasses

Cause I told you once already and I was very clear

I am too fucking busy to deal with you

Okay Im just being cool here

All right

What do we do here

This is a tough one

So Richard in terms of a player window what do you see

Well um I think its pretty straightforward

Ill handle this Richard

You dont have to

The whole reason were doing this friend is for branding value

So were gonna need a banner that says Powered by Pied Piper underneath the video window

It doesnt have to be too big but you dont want it to be too small either

Although theres nothing small about Homicide DoubleA

At least as far as I can tell

Also if its if its possible

Let me stop you right there Richard Were gonna need to have our logos on the car Blaines suit his helmet

If he wants to get a Flash tattoo or something on his neck thats on him

Actually um in all honesty Erlich just pretty much said exactly what I was gonna say

Uhhuh Um so Richard

Yes

Yeah

Do you think you can make the preview window full resolution

Um yes

Richard can give you whatever you need

But as far as the video player goes

Guys Im sorry I just remembered that Ive got somewhere else to be

All right Well DoubleA Ill see you soon

Im just gonna grab a shirt and well check you later

What the fuck dude Hey I love your tech

But come back tomorrow without KoolAid or dont come back at all

Honestly

Richard whats going on

What do you mean

Im catching kind of a vibe

A weird vibe with you and DoubleA

Right That Well

Im not gonna sugarcoat it Richard

I dont think he likes you

I mean he literally rolled his eyes at you

Why dont you just trust me on this one

Let KoolAid do the talking tomorrow

Take this stuff Im gonna grab a couple more drinks and another hat

Im gonna get a box




    push

Gavin This is a total fucking disaster

If my engineers had just told me they werent ready I never would have pushed for this live stream

Even worse now I hear those little Pied Piper fuckers are doing their own live stream with Homicide

The energy drink

Yes

Meanwhile Ive demanded to see internal testing from every facet of the Nucleus platform

So I can see for myself where I stand

Because all I hear from everybody is good news

Have I just surrounded myself with sycophants who are just telling me whatever I want to hear regardless of the truth

No

Thank you Denpok

I really needed to hear that

This might be morbid but the cold hard fact is that if Blaine dies on our live stream this could be good for us

I mean wed get a lot more traffic

Well and it would probably lead to calls for regulations in the stunt industry

So in the long term were saving lives

Although there is the moral problem with letting him die

Though he did tell us to shut up

And his name is Blaine

And Gina is super hot

And this would make her single

Shed probably need consoling so theres an opportunity

Opportunity

Dinesh Should we SWOT this



Bereaved women do tend to act out sexually

Yeah so thats a strength

Hey KoolAid

Yeah

And So

And

It wasnt meant to be a flattering nickname

It was an insult

Im not sure I agree with that

I mean the dancing pitcher breaks through walls to give tasty beverages to kids in need

Why would you infer from this that DoubleA doesnt like me

Well um I wasnt inferring anything

He told me to my face that he doesnt like you

But why wouldnt he like me

Well uh you have a tendency sometimes to

Why on earth wouldnt he like me

Because Erlich you tend to not let

I was his mentor You know

You know theres no remote possibility

Because you dont let people talk

It just happened

Um and he told me that if you came tomorrow that he would pull the plug on the whole live stream

sighs

I see

Sorry

Are you done talking now

Yes

Do Dinesh and Gilfoyle know about this

Uh no I came straight to you

What about Jared

No

Okay heres what you need to do

You need to go in tomorrow and you need to do that live stream

Put my feelings aside you know dont quit on account of me

I wasnt gonna I wasnt gonna quit

There is something you should know though

Aaron Anderson wasnt very well liked in college

In fact people used to call him DoubleAsshole

So watch out for that guy

Are you sure youre okay with this

Yes Richard Its time for me to be the bigger man

The cooler man

I am KoolAid after all

Ladies and gentlemen for the last 90 minutes you have had an opportunity to explore a standard HooliPhone upgraded with a brandnew operating system called Nucleus Thank you all for being here Aln Lisa Josh Yana Katie Ramón

Id like to get everyones first impressions

Whod like to jump in Anyone

How about you Ramón Its just stupid

Man Okay so Ramón feels the phone is stupid

Could you elaborate Ramón

Stupid how Please be as specific as possible Ramón

Well its slow

The apps keep quitting on me

I tried to watch a movie and it kept freezing up

And when Im typing like theres a delay

Then all the letters pop up at once

You took a good phone and you made it all like shitty

Keep in mind I didnt design the phone It pissed me off

Man I appreciate your honesty Ramón

Thats just one guys opinion

Who else feels this product is stupid

Allen Lisa Josh Yana Katie

And did it piss off anyone else

Allen Lisa Josh Yana Katie

Okay

Christina how bad is this Be honest

Is this Windows Vista bad

Its not iPhone 4 bad is it

sighs

fuck Dont tell me this is Zune bad

Im sorry Gavin Its Apple Maps bad

And who else felt this product is messed up

Allen Lisa Josh Yana

Gavin fuck

Im sorry for the disturbance Allen Lisa Josh Yana

So I can definitely get you full res on the preview window

Aw sweet

Cool Ill get right on that

You see how much smoother this all runs without Erlich hanging around

Right yeah

Hey did you ever send me the mockup for the logo placement of the player window

Seriously you should think about dropping that guy

But what do I know I just built a billiondollar company

Yeah Yeah okay But uh about the mockup for the logo placement

Oh hey I gotta go Skype with my European distributor Keep cranking it okay

Sure uh will do

Excuse me

Thats not the final graphic for the live stream is it

Yep DoubleA signed off on it

Just that Theres nothing else

Nope



Hm

Blaine doesnt die but he is horribly incapacitated

And then while hes in the hospital he gets a flesheating virus and then he dies

Well obviously his incessant suffering will be a strength

But our ability to enjoy it is an opportunity

What if before he dies

Gina catches the virus

And then she spreads it from her vg1n to your pen1s

Wait so in this scenario I get to have sx with Gina Thats an opportunity

Okay how about this

Im listening

We let Blaine die but then hes not around to stop someone else from committinsome huge fuckedup act of evil

The kll htler scenario

Right

knocking on door

Hey guys You guys busy

Uh

Cool

Um I got something I gotta say

Listen I know that I was really rude to both of you yesterday

Its just um when I got a stunt coming up Im a bundle of nerves and sometimes I can take that out on other people

Even with all the support that I get from Gina and our kids

Okay I dont know why

But and then again Im a guy who needs to risk his life jumping over stuff

So whats that all about right laughs

You know actually just an hour ago I spotted an error in my math

Would have had me smeared across the side of that building

Uh Anyway now Im just totally rambling

Typical Blaine

What I wanted to say was that Im sorry

Are we cool

Yeah were cool Thanks for stopping by

Yeah you should go quickly cause we have work to do

Whats this

What is that

Let Blaine die

Oh Shit We write in code we write in code

This is compression

Strengths

Blaines last moment is realizing face is gone

Weaknesses Blaine dies super fast

Yeah you really shouldnt be looking at that Thats all proprietary

Opportunities fuck Gina

Would you believe that was here when we came in

DoubleA Can I talk to you for a second

Uh yeah Leave me alone for a sec Whats up

Well okay uh I just saw a version of the player window that apparently you approved of that says Powered by Homicide on it

Oh Yeah it does

Right Well theres no Pied Piper logo

Like anywhere So whats up with that

Oh well

Homicide is an energy drink and power means energy

So thats kind of confusing to the consumer so I think were gonna keep it the way it is

Uh the whole point of doing this was so that we could get our name out there Remember

I tell you what Lets see how it goes this time the next time well work something out

Uh no No We cant see how it goes this time

There is no next time Okay

We are racing to get our platform ready for CES

And we took time away from doing that to do this so we could get PR value

If no one sees the logo then theres no PR value at all

Oh man Im sorry But you get it

No I dont get it

Okay look you have to put our logo in the viewer Thats it Period

Mm actually I dont have to do a damn thing

Yeah you do

No I dont

Okay then neither do I

Richard dont be an asshole like your buddy KoolAid Okay

Just finish the build okay

You know what DoubleA

Erlich was right

You are an asshole

In fact youre a doubleasshole

silence

Richard clears throat

What did you call me

I I called you a doubleassle

Cause you know youre being an asshole

DoubleA doubleasshole You know

Youre twice the asshole Twicehole Doubleasshole

Oh Ew Is that a colostomy bag

Do you have any idea what its like to be ten years old and carry your own shit around in a bag

To have two assholes

I didnt know

Hey Richard We should go

Blaine Opportunities urinate on Blaines grave

Grief threesome with Gina and Blaines hot mom question mark

What the fuck

I didnt

Gilfoyle Richard

But I mean you were being an asshole

Okay good luck

laughing To his face

You called him that to his face

How could you not mention the colostomy bag

Because its a very private and personal matter laughs

Its not a laughing matter But you called him doubleasshole first

Remember In college

Yeah but not to his face

Never to his face Not even Im not that fucking cruel

But you are

Im actually not

You tore doubleasshole a third asshole

laughs TripleA

laughing

Yeah that was all my fault somehow

Erlich laughing

Yeah that was a big wank

Since were already set up for a live stream might I make a suggestion

Wow It looks even better than I thought it would



Dinesh Is that a still image

Its not frozen is it

No its live Its just not moving very much because its a fucking egg

But think of the wonderful things going on inside that egg

The resolution in your imagination is infinite

Oh hey were up to 17 views

Okay well this isnt the PR coup that wed envisioned

But uh Nucleus fucked up way worse

At least we can go back to work knowing that were the only middleout compression that actually functions

New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc Steelaged

Drinks great during the day

I can move so you guys can stand next to each other

Jared Dude no

God no

phone vibrating

Russ hey

Good job my man fucking live stream looks amazing

It does

Yeah Homicide must be stoked

Homicide What

Russ I love the new name Its kickass

I always thought Pied Piper was kind of a limpdick name

EndFrame is way cooler EndFrame What

tires screeching

Man Three two one

He made it Farewell sweet Gina

Powered by EndFrame Who the fuck is EndFrame

Why is their fucking logo on this live stream

EndFrame isnt you guys

Oh fuck

EndFrame is those guys that brainraped us at Branston Ventures

EndFrame is a compression company specializing in middleout compression technology

Those pricks They stole my algorithm

I know guys at the FBI we could call Were you fucking hacked

Uh actually no

Well how did they get it then

Im sorry

How did they get it then Richard

How did they get it Well we kinda found ourselves in their conference room and accidentally sketched out our key components to our algorithms data model on their whiteboards

Russ You fucking

Russ

He hung up

Id file this one under Weakness Jared
