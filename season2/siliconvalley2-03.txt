Richard This is a good buyout

Its way better than what Gavin offered before

And our packages include nice salaries cash earnouts stock in Hooli which vests after only four years of working there

I mean this seems like a pretty good deal right

Hooli You really think wed go work for Hooli

What the fuck is wrong with you Richard

What other options do we have

We need serious funding to go up against Nucleus and we dont have that

So listen

I will listen to the sound of you chortling on my balls

Okay

Richard Im an independent businessman

Emphasis on independent

And business

And man come to think of it

Count me out

Actually youre not being offered employment at Hooli

They give you a full buyout

How big

Okay maybe Im not explaining this right

I mean when you hear Gavin Belson say it it sounds much clearer

He saying rather than put us out of business hed prefer to just take us and make us part of his um Hoo

Okay that does sound bad

But you just had to be there okay Hes very articulate

Richard you didnt leave your drink unattended around Gavin did you

Yeah you dont sound like yourself

Im fine And for what its worth Monica thinks this is the right thing for us to do

What

You told Monica about this before you told us

I dont know Gilfoyle

I guess I thought Monica would actually give this rational thought as opposed to ordering me to chortle her balls

Guys Richards right

Its a pretty good deal all things considered and Richard Id understand if you took it

Thank you Jared

But Hooli was like an abusive spouse to me

You know like that guy who married Julia Roberts in Sleeping With The Enemy

It was dehumanizing

But then you Richard you pulled me out of the life and you gave me hope and you gave me a sense of selfworth

Like Richard Gere did to Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman

This is weird

Every day here has been like that shoppingspree scene

Im putting on hats

Okay

Julia Roberts aside are you guys saying that youd rather me let Pied Piper die

Cause thats whats going to happen if we dont take this deal

Face it Gavin has us cornered

He has you cornered

Yeah we can just go work on our apps

Sorry Im not going to go work for Hooli

Same for me except for the part about being sorry

And this buyout sucks Ill have nothing to do with it

If youre going to go at this one it sounds like youre going to have to go at it alone hoss

Okay so if I go to Hooli you dont want your check

Of course I want my check What are you insane

But I think its important for me to show my dissatisfaction by walking out on you

Richard Id understand if you took it but watching you end up over there would break my heart

What like Julia Roberts from My Best Friends Wedding

I never saw it

theme music playing

hip hop blaring

Richard Hendricks

music stops

Whats happening

Russ Hanneman True pleasure to meet you

Oh yeah I think I recognize you from TV

Yeah you do

Uh how do you know who I am

Good question No reason I would

But I watched your whole TechCrunch thing online twice

That whole spazz thing you did moaning sputtering

laughs That was fucking priceless

So I called the Pied Piper number and somebody said you were heading over to Hooli

The guy sounded like he was either Chinese or retarded

Uh JianYang

Yeah I dont know what that means

You know Richard back before I blew up I got fucked with too

You think youre the first guy to take this ride

Youre hot youre sued then the guy suing you offers you a buyout am I right

Wow yeah actually youre exactly right

Thats whats happening

Like my ride

Um

They dont make it in this color They did it just for me

Guys in this town dont have the balls to drive a car like this

Theyre billionaires and they drive fuckin Priuses

Why

I think mainly uh just environmental concerns

Theyre all lemmings Richard Everyone in this town is

Just look at them Lemming lemming

Okay

I scratched my car

Must be the rivet in my pants These are cool pants too

fuck thats a deep scratch That will not buff out

mtherfucker fuck it

Let me ask you a question Richard

Have you ever had beef

Like with someone like fighting

No the food

Oh yeah

No you havent Get in

Okay

Giddy up

You in

Almost

Lets do this Richard

Okay

music blaring Shit D Drive

Come on fuck you Drive

Which is why I counsel any young founder today to pursue your dream not for profit or valuation or material wealth but for the good of humanity

Which is easy for you to say being a billionaire

audience laughs

Let me change the subject I have

I dont care for your tone Kara

Im getting a little tired of this bias against the leaders of our industry

Im continually creating jobs and helping people and Im tired of getting slapped for it

I didnt steal the money I have and I resent being treated like I did

You know there is a climate in this country that is very dangerous

Its dangerous out there for billionaires

audience laughs

Theres that attitude again Kara

Billionaires are people too

We are leaders in technology in industry in finance

Look at history

Do you know who else vilified a tiny minority of financiers and progressive thinkers called the Jews

all jeering

Wait a minute Did you just compare the treatment of billionaires in America today to the plight of the Jews in nzi Germany

Absolutely

One could argue that billionaires are actually treated worse

And we didnt even do anything wrong

Were an even smaller minority

Theres a lot more of them

These are facts

Russ So then it hits me

We take this thing called the radio and put it on this new thing called the Internet

And no one was doing it No one

So we started hoovering up the deals

Eat this open your mouth Open your mouth a bit

Eat it eat it Dont chew just let it dissolve

Hold This is very hot

Hold

It just think its physically impossible for it to dissolve in my mouth

Now chew chew chew

Ha Its very hot

Its good its good

Good Its the fucking best This whole place is

You call this place and they dont know you they pretend they dont speak English You see a white face in here

No you dont

Anyway next thing you know we IPO stock triples in a day and AOL gobbles us up

All of a sudden Im 22 years young and Im worth 12B

Now a couple decades later Im worth 14 You do the math

Okay Well thats a gain of 200 million over 20 years

Um 1666 repeating

Uh thats less than 1 return

Inflation is like 17

I think CDs are 2

So thats less than a CD

Well no one ever got laid putting money in the bank Am I right

Those bad boys right there theyre all you

You gotta flip em over That sides done

Listen Richard I want to back you

You build whatever the fuck youve got going in that crazy fuckedup genius brain up there

Its all up to you Im white glove hands the fuck off

Lets make you a billion dollars

Lets make me a billion more Hows that sound

Youre not worried about the lawsuit

Shit no I got three nannies suing me right now one of them for no reason

So come on lets do this

Lets kick Gavin Belsons teeth in at CES

And then when youre really worth something Im gonna take you back to those same spineless VCs who said no and Im gonna shove you right up their assholes

Um thats a very enticing offer

And I wish I didnt have to do this Hooli thing but I should probably at least

Should No no Richard Dont do what you should do

Do what you want

I mean should I pay 800 bucks for that tiny piece of meat

Of course not But I do it anyway

Because I want it

Simple question Richard What do you want

Gentlemen whats the update on the apps

Or the appdate if you will

I will not

Heres my appdate I was excited to work on it and then I looked at it with fresh eyes

Um Wajeed was right Its really shitty

I dont know what the fuck I was thinking

But I bought your pitch

Yeah you fucked up too

My app is still great

But in the time that weve been dicking around with Pied Piper 10 other apps that basically do the exact same thing have come out

Guys if I list you as references can I count on you to say nice things about me

Be honest

Do you want me to be honest or nice

What did you get a parking ticket or something

Oh

Yeah I still cant see it Could you use your mouth

Uh all right Just read it

5 million

Yeah yeah You guys are not going back to Hooli and neither am I

How the fuck did you get that

Russ Hanneman

Oh Monica I see you got my text

Are you out of your mind

Uh nice to see you too and no Im not

Youre putting your entire future in the hands of the man who put radio on the Internet

I can only assume that he mentioned that to you

It may have come up

Dinesh Oh this guy

Thats the guy

Yeah thats Thats the guy

Does he actually smile like that with his upper and lower teeth at the same time

Monica The guy is a joke

How does he even do that Hes a boorish pompous womanizing douchebag who got lucky like 20 years ago

And hasnt done anything since then

Sounds like Erlich

Sounds like he knows who he is and he doesnt apologize for it

So hes a joke Who cares

This joke is willing to give us 5 million to fund Pied Piper

And he doesnt own anything This whole thing is a loan

Yeah the demand note is structured as a loan

But he does have the option to take repayment in the form of equity and he does get two board seats right off the bat

Which means you wont get rid of him ever

If you succeed he gets a huge chunk of Pied Piper and if you fail this lunatic has ratchets to seize control of the company

Love it or hate it at least Hooli is a real company

You should take their offer

I should I should

But Im tired of doing what I should do and I kind of want to start doing what I want to do

And what I want to do is a be a selfcentered irrational asshole that doesnt compromise on anything at all ever And when Pied Piper is a big fucking deal Russ is going to take us back to all those VCs who passed on us and shove us right up their fucking assholes

What

Yeah I dont want any part of that last bit

It sounded it sounded better when Russ said it

Again I am not good at quoting in context

It doesnt matter Im Im going to

Im going to call Ron LaFlamme and Im going to tell him that were taking Russs money

Okay so Im supposed to tell Laurie Bream that she is publicly coinvested with Russ fucking Hanneman

So youd rather me sell my soul to Gavin Belson than you just having an awkward conversation with your boss

Oh thanks Monica

The guy has calf implants Richard

How do they look

Gavin Everyone on Twitter is saying Im an antiSemite

You were there

Denpok I was

And what I saw was an anti antiSemite

phone chimes

Hello Did you hear from Hendricks

What do you mean he went with someone else Who did he go with

Are you fucking kidding me

Russ Hanneman

Thats right

The Russ Hanneman with whom I am familiar

Yes

That that is with whom they chose to go

Russ Hanneman

Yes

Hes a vulgar human being

Hes utterly distasteful

And it would not be inaccurate to say that we at Raviga are now coinvestors with Russ Hanneman

I tried to talk him out of it

Mmhmm

I did but you know what

Peter used to say that ever successful company could look back at a defining moment early on where they would have died had it not been for the The courage and the tenacity and maybe the insanity of one visionary person who put it all on the line even though it seemed like a huge mistake at the time

A moment where all the metrics and the numbers didnt mean anything It was all about the emotion

It was about belief rational or irrational

And I think I hope that I just witnessed that

I did not understand any of what you just said

Oh None of it

None of it

I will not interact with Russ Hanneman in any way

Is that clear

It is Laurie

I feel very strongly that you should have prevented this

This exchange is now over

Okay but I

This exchange is now over thank you




    push

Jared Well Richard

Firstly congratulations on finally being funded

I hope you took a little time out to enjoy this moment and celebrate I certainly did

You did

I did indeed

I celebrated earlier this morning

You did this morning

Oh yeah

But now its down to business

We have a huge amount of work to do between now and January

I know 5 million sounds like a lot of money but even if we set our burnrate conservatively its only going to last 18 months

Litigation wipes out half our funds right off the bat

And we have to stand up servers pay for financial and HR pay LaFlamme and payroll alone is going to be pretty hefty

Did you see the hiring proposals that Dinesh and Gilfoyle submitted

No

Theyre untenable

Well I need four webapp devs two front end two back end

I need a guy to turn your ref code into a productionquality library

I need two more guys to port the decompression libraries to Javascript iOS Android and I need a few more guys to build out our APIs so I need all those guys

Ditto I need every one of those guys on my list

Okay its just that theres Thats 15 people each

I mean thats like an entire division at Facebook

Fine I could do it with 12

I could do it with 11 because Im a better leader than Dinesh

Okay great

Good news I got them to cut it down to 12 and 11

A positive step but um we need to cut a little deeper

Okay well whats the max amount of people we can afford to hire for them

Three for each of them

Three Are you serious

Can you just tell them

Oh I have several times But um they just kept saying if I didnt waste so much money at the butthole doctor then wed have enough money but I pay for all my medical out of pocket

We can only afford to hire three people for each of you

Im sorry but thats it

Okay thats fine It works for me

What

If you could do it with three people why didnt you just say so

Because were negotiating against each other

No were not Were on the same team

We want the same thing

Disagree I just got you to give me three guys for a job I could easily do with two

God damn it

knocking Knock knock whos there

This guy Hey Russ whats up

How are you

Im good What brings you here

I had to meet this lawyer and his fucking kids sick so now I have a few hours to kll

Did I see a McLaren 650 S with the extratrim package pull into the driveway

Or did I not

Yep

So this is the team

Whoa Im just gonna say it

This guy fucks Am I right

Cause Im looking at the rest of you guys and this is the guy in the house doing all the fucking

Am I right You know Im right

This guy fucks

Hey whats up alQaeda

No Im totally kidding Im diffusing the tension with humor

What tension Theres tension

No of course not Seriously though no beheadings all right

Russ Hanneman How you doing mtherfucker

Aw man

I want to know what kind of fuckedup childhood this guy had

laughs

All right fellas what are we doing here

Mr Hanneman I am Erlich Bachman

I am the owner and proprietor of this house

So I can give you a tour of the premises if you like show you where the actual fucking happens

Nah Im good phone swooshes

Listen I dont want to disturb the flow

I just wanted to check out the magic in action

So Im gonna grab a seat right over there Gonna be a fly on the wall

Im not gonna say a word

We have a meeting that we were going to do so maybe we could do that

It was nice to meet you Russ

So I think well actually save a lot of time if we got on the same page in regards to the budget

So what I need from you guys is to

Im sorry do you really talk like that

Like what

Like that

I mean this is this is my normal speaking voice

Like right now like how youre talking is that real

This one This this is real

Wow All right yeah Doesnt matter go go

Okay

Thats more in line with

Okay back to it

Get a fucking pen Go again

Say it one more time

The address is

Go for it

Its 5230 Newell Road

Keep going Did you get that

I dont know This fucker

Gavin That little Hendricks prick fucked me over again

I want this suit to be more than a holding action

I want to win it What can we do here

Well this lawsuit is going to be a protracted and timeconsuming ordeal

But with our superior resources top litigators we feel this gives us the advantage over Pied Piper Translation

Ultimately the suit will turn based on proving that Pied Piper was created here at Hooli

Now so far concrete evidence of that is thin

So thicken it

Gavin your visitors are here

Ah gentlemen And lady

Shalom aleichem

Thank you for coming today to open a dialogue

Now if youll follow me

In an effort to hardwire sensitivity into our corporate mindspace Im having a scale replica of the Hall of Names at Yad Vashem constructed right next to the bike shop

Richard sighs Okay so

No no no no no Its got to be afternoon Afternoon

video game playing No no Bring him too

Which Raoul Lawyer Raoul

Litigation and payroll are both capped SGA we still have a little wiggle room

video game continues

And were going to punt

Sir you know you can turn the volume down on that

Just on the side

Richard Where does that leave us Um

Lets go open an IPA huh

Im sorry what I couldnt hear you Someone was talking

What did you say Keep going keep going

Right Richard one potential issue

Our hosting fees could become a challenge as we scale

Right but we can offset a lot of that once we get a few customers and start a subscriptionrevenue model

What Revenue No no no no no

No revenue Ill call you back What

Why would you go after revenue

Because To make money

No If you show revenue people will ask How much

And it will never be enough

The company that was the 100xer the 1000xer becomes the 2x dog

But if you have no revenue you can say youre prerevenue

Youre a potential pure play

Its not about how much you earn its about what youre worth And whos worth the most

Companies that lose money

Pinterest Snapchat No revenue

Amazon has lost money every fucking quarter for the last 20 fucking years and that Bezos mtherfucker is the king

The king

Theres no revenue No one wants to see revenue

Go

Oh uh

I just thought that mainly the goal of companies is to make money

Yeah no no no Thats not how it works

I dont want to make a little bit of money every day

I want to make a fuck ton of money all at once

ROI

ROI You know what that stands for

Uh return on inv

Return on investment

No Radio on Internet

Internet

Did you put radio on the Internet

Uh no

So everything you just did do the opposite

So you want us to take files and make them bigger

That guy

That guy is crazy I love that guy

Uh you said that you were going to be handsoff

Is that still happening

Yes please Do me a favor make the right fucking decisions and leave me the fuck out You think Corey wants to be here

Corey lets bounce Come on

Uh Richard The check

Right

Um Mr Hanneman I think the bank had some issue with the check

Uh they said the funds are on hold for some reason

Wait you didnt try to cash that check did you

laughs Did you try to cash that check I gave you

Thats the show check Thats the one you frame and put up on your wall

You didnt try to cash that did you

Um so do we arrange a wire transfer or

No No you dont get it all at once

We set your burn rate and then I cut you a new check every other week between now and CES in January unless you fuck up too badly

All right hit it hard boys

This guy fucks

You know Russ Ive been known to fuck myself

door closes

Well hes the worst man in America

And now he owns us

Richard sighs

Why the fuck would he have us come all the way out here

I dont know

Boys

Russ whats up Um

I know you had asked us to concentrate more on branding and less about the The product but we were thinking about that and

I got it

God

No No shitheads Look

Richard Oh I am Pied Piper

Who is that

Dinesh Yeah how is she Pied Piper

What is this

Brand awareness

Were getting Pied Piper out there

Right But what exactly is the product

I mean whats Whats this selling

Pied Piper idiot

I like it

Uhhuh

Yeah heres the new check I promised you

This one you can cash Obviously I had to subtract the cost of the ad agency that nailed that slogan

The photo legal layout plus the cost of the 15 billboards

Dont worry I gave you guys a sweet deal on them

Gave us

Yeah

Hanneman Outdoor Media I own the billboards

Thats how I talked the ad agency into giving you guys that slogan for only 30 grand Synergy bitches

Know what that means

Does it mean taking a stack of cash and lighting it on fire

Crazy fuck I love this guy

laughs You fucking guy

Oh and get this I found out where Gavin Belson lives and I placed 15 of these babies between his house and his office And guess where I placed the biggest one of all

This is the most hostile and aggressive act of provocation Ive ever had to endure

It crosses every line of decency

This is war

You better have something good for me

We believe we have a way to win this case

What if there were an individual here at Hooli with whom Hendricks had had a lot of contact

What if this individual were arguably a member of the original Pied Piper team

What if we took steps to present this individual in a light such that his talents were undeniable

Surely an individual this brilliant would move quickly up the ladder here at Hooli

Surely hed be promoted rapidly and repeatedly no

And surely these impressive promotions would lead a court to agree that someone this brilliant who was there at the inception of Pied Piper must be integral to if not solely responsible for its creation Its all right You can come in

Mmm So youre saying the more praise and promotion we heap on this person the more it looks like Pied Piper was created here at Hooli

phone chiming Big Head

Uh sorry Sorry guys

Uh Hooli phone

I didnt even know the ringer was on

No ones ever actually called it before
