Jared we were supposed to get a term sheet today

Have we heard from Peter Gregory keyboard clicks

Peter Gregory is dead

What

keyboard clicks

 

Holy shit

He was the smartest shrewdest

scoffs strangest man Ive ever known

I cant believe that hes gone

clears throat Can I asked what happened

Yeah He was in the Serengeti on safari

Ah and he had just gone into his tent when a hippo wandered into the camp

Oh wow

He was attacked by a hippo

No I guess the hippo started to charge when the guide grabbed his r1fle and shot at it but his aim was off and

And he shot Peter Gregory by accident

Yeah

No he he missed but I guess the sound of the gn startled Peter who ran out of his tent and

Ran right into the hippo

No the hippo was also startled by the noise and had run off prior to Peter exiting his tent

So what happened to Peter

He hadnt run in a long time maybe ever and you know he just

That was it

Oh that is so very strange clears throat

Very sad and tragic

Very sad and strange

Richard Wow

 

See ya

Man that is so weird I mean one minute Peter Gregory is here the next hes just gone

Jared its Erlich

I need you to set up all the other VC meetings ASAP

Line em up nuts to butts

What are you doing Monica just said theyre still gonna fund us

We should just sit tight

Look I loved Peter Gregory maybe even more than he loved me but theres something you need to know here something that Monica isnt exactly volunteering up and thats all of these oneman firms have a key man clause

Do you know what that means

No

It means that now that Peter Gregory is gone all the Raviga investors have the contractual right to cash out and walk away which means that by the end of the day there may not be a Raviga

Seriously

Yes so we have to prepare for that

Now I know that it makes me sound like a terrible person but we have a company to run And do you know who the first person to agree with me would be

Peter Gregory

Woman And that is the very first spot in our new campaign heralding the upcoming release of Nucleus this January at CES

Any questions

I have a question

That was horrible I just got humiliated by a fucking teenager at TechCrunch Disrupt and you give me this tampon ad

A girl with diabetes on a swing

I think she has cancer

At least thats how I read it

I dont care what kind of disease she had

All I care about is that Nucleus is better than Pied Piper

Hendricks just left us all in the dust

If we get this wrong we could blow the business opportunity of a lifetime

Data creation is exploding

With all the selfies and useless files people refuse to delete on the cloud 92 of the worlds data was created in the last two years alone

At the current rate the worlds data storage capacity will be overtaken by next spring

It will be nothing short of a catastrophe

Data shortages data rationing data black markets

Someones compression will save the world from datageddon and it sure as hell better be Nucleus and not gddmn Pied Piper

I dont know about you people but I dont wanna live in a world where someone else makes the world a better place better than we do

Datageddon Is he married to that or

Theres just been a lot of geddons lately

Thats true Snowmageddon Carmageddon

Theres that movie Armageddon

 

Laurie you wanted to see me

Monica come in come in Im sure youve heard by now that Ive been named our new managing partner

Yes Congratulations

Did the limited partners tell you how they made their decision

Oh they looked at the portfolio performances of each of the senior partners over the last several funds and my numbers were objectively the most favorable

Therefore I was selected

Yeah its just managing partner is all about meeting with people and interacting with people

You can sit down if you want to Do you want to

Oh

Or should we stand

Uh I whatever Im standing

Okay

But you dont have to

Okay

Would it make you feel awkward to sit

Im okay to stand

Monica Of course

Peter Gregory is dead

Yes I know

On a personal note his death is very sad

But on a professional level its untenable

Ive been reviewing his files

He was pursuing a number of extremely dubious positions

Are you aware that we own a 30 million ostrich farm in Morocco or that we are the majority stakeholders in three companies that specialize in invisibility

This box is filled with napkins covered with notes detailing Peters conviction that geneticallymodified cranberry fungus would become the next cotton

That That one I remember yes

Monica

Mmhmm

Peter Gregory is dead

Yes

We need to seem competitive now more than ever to our investors as well as to the industry at large

Well I mean Pied Piper is probably the hottest early investment in town right now and we have them

Do we

But why then are they speaking to other firms about investing in their Series A

No no I just told them to sit tight for a day or two until we sorted things out

It seems that that advanced a sense of uncertainty and now were at risk of losing their round

This could jeopardize the firm and by extension your career here Monica as an associate partner

Well I guess I was just kind of in shock

Monica

sighs

Peter Gregory is dead

 

Yes I know

Erlich chuckles This is great

Do you know how many times Ive gone into these rooms with nothing but a half of an ass in my hand

Were walking in there with threefoot cocks covered in Elvis dust

Really

Richard Hendricks Theyre ready for you

This is a fucking layup guys

Okay lets do this

 

Not you Jared

Now with proper funding we should be able to put together a functioning beta in time for CES and compress Nucleus out of the marketplace

both chuckle

Yeah

I dont know

You dont What

It just doesnt seem worked out to me

Well I mean it was worked out enough to win TechCrunch Disrupt

Yes and congratulations you won 50 grand but youre asking us for 200 times that

Richard look we all know about your amazing compression rate but lets not be naive here

You cant expect to just throw money at an algorithm and beat one of the largest tech companies in the world so why dont you rework this a little and come back in with a little more

Maybe next week

And

That was really weird

I guess we dont have as much Elvis dust on us as I thought

You see This is why I wanted to go with Peter Gregory

This is bullshit That guy throws this huge party for us and then acts like he doesnt even want us

I fucking hate parties And hes just Come back next week when you have more

More More than 52 on Weissman

scoffs No No

fuck that guy fuck this place fuck this whole place

Watch me fuck this place

No wait Wait wait

Hey Remember when you told me to come back when I had more

And then I said I would Well Im not going to

Ever This doesnt count

Im covered in dust Im a threefoot dick and Ive got half an ass to go to some other company whos never gonna put me on a Jumbotron or throw balls at me

Bye

Are you feeling unwell Do you need protein

I dont know what happened

Between Peter dying and Raviga maybe being gone I just I just wanna get funded and build Pied Piper

I hate this part

Well if one thing is for sure sighs if were gonna get any traction I need to step up my game




    push

cellphone chimes

Its an email from Ron LaFlamme

Just got a term sheet from SternTaylor They offered five million at 25 million postmoney valuation More than I thought

Shit They were negging us

Negging

Negging is going negative

Its a manipulative sx strategy used by lonely chauvinists

See everybody wants us By sh1tting all over us they try and bring our price down but you sh1tting all over them counteracted them sh1tting all over us

You negged a neg Richard this could be good

Where do we have next RossLoma Capital

Should I keep doing it Should I keep negging

No no Ill handle this

If they want to negotiate using hostility and rudeness well they picked the wrong guy

Well you see our main concern is how youre going to achieve escape velocity on your growth rate

chuckling hit critical mass

Im sorry What Whats funny

Its just that painting behind you

Its awful

It looks like harlequin Kama Sutra done poorly

So I agree bad culture fit

I think we all just move on

Look I didnt say anything about a culture fit

No I did

Okay Well thank you for meeting with us

We have a bunch of these things to go to hopefully with more tasteful artwork and your logo looks like a sideways vg1n

I find that to be racist dont you

 

Okay heres my concern Heres my concern

Who the hell picked out that shirt for you

What

Oh I see

With the pants so I guess its a whole thing

My wife picked these out

Then you married poorly

Do you care about Pied Piper

Do I care about Pied Piper Well of course

Cause if you do Im not seeing it

In fact what I think Im seeing is the human equivalent of a flassid pen1s

Flaksid Its actually pronounced flaksid

Not a lot of people know that

Well we are definitely interested but I think we need to

Im sorry Is something wrong

No this is all wrong

I am sensing a general lack of vision

Your muffins smell like shit

So do your ideas

One of you is the least attractive person Ive ever seen and Im not gonna say who

Should we leave or should you

We just got offered eight at 40

Were five for five gentlemen

And Galveston Capital Fund and Yountville Ventures called

They want to move their meetings up before everyone else

Hey let me try I want to be rude at this next one

Go for it

So with some proper funding we should be able to get a functioning beta in time for CES

And if you dont fund us youre a fucking slut

music stops

Ah Whats that smell

Is that a fart You Are you a farter

Now can I have a pastry Or are you guys gonna eat em all

Cause youre gonna get fat

Its not your fault Richard This is just something that cant be taught so leave the next one to me I can feel a big one coming on

What are you gonna do

Im not sure yet but give me room

Theres something inside of me that has to come out and who am I to stop it

computer beeps

His balls

He put his balls on the table

Right on the table

On purpose

I dont see how it could be by accident

Richard I just got an email from the guys at MidlandOak

Apparently there is a line and I crossed it

The line between 12 and 15 million

Babam MidlandOaks offer just came in

Gentlemen we are valued at 75 million fully diluted

Are you sh1tting me

Take a look at these term sheets

There is a linear correlation between how intolerable I was and the height of valuation

Hey you guys This is Laurie Bream the new managing partner at Raviga

Hi Im Richard Hendricks

Yes I recognize you from your photograph

Its very nice to meet you in person

Yeah

Okay so we did that

Gentlemen I am aware of the degree of interest you are receiving from other firms

I am aware that participation in your Series A will require a very competitive offer but for numerous reasons I believe it to be the prudent decision

Now I am presenting you with this

20 million at 100 million valuation

I dont uh

This is way more than any other offer

Correct That is very much intentional

So I believe that satisfies your requirements

Monica will arrange a time to formalize the details

Thank you Have a good day

Uh thank you

 

Yes

Yes chuckles

Congratulations guys I am so glad

car engine starts Oh shit Shes my ride home

Ill call you Richard

Yeah okay

Wait Laurie hold on Thanks for stopping

guys laughing

Guys I think were funded

Yes Richie

Oh yeah

urine pattering

Erlich So I push my dick to the side unbutton the bottom buttons laughter and bam

Ah What are you doing

Shit Sorry sorry Sorry

stammers Meet me on the side of the house

I okay

Okay Go

Hey

Hey whats up

If anyone finds out that I came back here I will get fired okay

Okay

Dont take this deal

What

You are worth half that at best

Oh Wow Thanks for the compliment

No The credit to you guys You negotiated your asses off but this is a classic runaway valuation

Whats wrong with that

Pied Piper will be tied to this crazy valuation that you will never be able to live up to

If you dont keep increasing in value in the next round if you have a down round you are fucked

It is the kiss of death for a young CEO

You want to start with a realistic valuation and grow at a reasonable pace

Okay well if its such a shitty deal then why did your boss offer it to us

Because shes as competitive as hell

She needs Pied Piper to keep Raviga afloat Richard

Okay

Look I respect Laurie but this is the exact type of thing Peter never did

Richard come on I own shares in Pied Piper

If this high a valuation was good in the longterm would I be standing here risking my job

Dont take our offer Maybe go with the lowest offer you got

Even that might be too high

Again thank you for the compliment

Also I didnt see anything in there

No Yeah thank you

I was gonna say if you had youd have to show me yours too

chuckles nervously

Umm clears throat

Okay

Okay Thanks for the

 

clicking

 

Yeah sorry about that party

I was in kind of a bad way that night

And truth is Im actually doing okay

Good Thats great

Yeah

I mean I could run the scenarios about what happened all I want but I finally just realized theres just nothing I could do you know

Yeah but I finally just realized theres just nothing I could do you know

Yeah

So Im at peace with it all

I was thinking actually

What if you had asked for less

What

Well what if you couldve gone to someone and asked for less than what they offered that first round

You mean like negotiating them down

Yeah

Can Can you even do that

Well yeah I mean why not

Yeah but

I mean I guess technically I could have

Mmm

Huh

Yeah I suppose you could argue that it mightve been easier to hit more realistic benchmarks and reach cash flow breakeven

Yeah thats what Im saying

And then sighs we wouldnt have faced that down round and we wouldnt have had to settle for acquisition

All that money fucked me

Wow I mean I dont know about

Shit

Maybe

Look Hey

No no no We couldve done a legit Series B

Right Id still be CEO

Id have my job my kickass house

Id probably still have my girlfriend and

fuck

Okay

Why the fuck didnt anyone tell me I could take less

I dont know I dont know

Ideas come up and then

fuck

 

Ill take a cab so Ill leave you to it

Thanks for meeting me

fuck

Richard

Richard Im Laurie Bream I was inside your home yesterday

Have you made a decision regarding our proposal

Uh yeah yeah well go with you guys but we need to renegotiate the terms

Oh Im afraid thats untenable

Were offering as much money as we can

No no we wanna go lower We want less

A lot less actually

Well go with Raviga if you guys do 10 million at a 50 million valuation not 20 at 100

I think this is more reasonable and its my final offer Take it or leave it

I was not anticipating this but I think it will be workable from our end

And one more thing Monica votes for Ravigas board seat

Certainly that seems unimportant

I will telephone your lawyer tomorrow and we can speak about the relevant details

Good

blues music playing

Peter was one of the few who genuinely took action to use technology to help humanity thrive

But how exactly can we quantify another humans contributions to mankind

Lets break it down into its three component elements

clicking

I met Peter when he was thinking about investing in my company Zetasphere although I think he was hesitant after his disappointing initial return from Snapchat

He came on board anyway and every month we would meet

Peter was always an honest man and I know that if Peter were here with us today he would say that he was not disappointed in Snapchat and he would forgive you Lev for your misunderstanding

Thats just the kind of guy that Peter was

Warm generous and not disappointed in Snapchat

clears throat Ill never forget the first time I met Peter

It was in his moms garage where we started our first business together

Manufacturing VGA graphics cards for IBM clones

We never looked back

And you know the last time I saw him it was at a restaurant not a halfmile away from that same garage

We talked as old friends do

He asked me about Jackson Hole I asked him about Pilates

And yet something was wrong

Underneath it all there was an unmistakable tension

A tension I will forever regret

Its no secret Peter and I had our differences

We let business get between us

Now

Now I wish I could say Im sorry for that

Its too late Hes gone and it makes me realize the importance of forgiveness of doing things with love and compassion in your heart and not vengeance and competition

I mean we owe that to each other dont we

And to him

After all this valley is the place Peter himself helped build

Where we come together as dreamers all of us to truly make the world a better place

This is Florence during the Renaissance

This is Camelot

This is the place Peter himself called the cradle of innovation

sighs I will miss my friend

Bye Pete

Maybe he is a human after all

phone chimes
