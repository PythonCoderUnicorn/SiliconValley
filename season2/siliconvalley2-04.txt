Thanks for coming in and sitting down with us

Were really excited to meet a few good engineers to join the Pied Piper Team

So why dont you tell us a little about yourself

I dont work before noon

Or after 200 PM

And I need to bring my dog to work

Are you are you dogfriendly

Oh yeah you can bring your dog to work

Thats not what I asked

Are you dogfriendly

Um

Nice pool Can my dog go in

Yeah yeah were very dogfriendly

Is there a lifeguard

Um Cause my dog cant swim

It says here on your resume that from 2010 to 2011 you crushed it

Thats actually an old resume It should also read that I crushed it from 2013 to present

So are we to understand that you did not crush it in 2012

There was a medical situation preventing me from crushing it to my usual standards

So I had to take some time off until I was able to crush it at 100 at which point I resumed crushing it fulltime

So it says here that youre proficient in C code assembly for multiple processor architectures and that you are a cyborg

That is correct short for cybernetic organism

I came into this world of filth and pain with a congenital heart condition requiring the installation of a pacemaker upon which I am mortally dependent

Mmm

Wow hes technically a cyborg

Yeah yeah Makes the resume accurate

Look we all know that I can make a shitload more money working for some multicolored Happy Town in a hermeticallysealed box

But permission to be honest

Permission granted

Granted

I like that you guys are so weird

Mmm

Yes we are the weird ones

theme music playing

This morning you put your soda cans in the green one

Okay Thats not right

The green is for grass and leaves

Okay

The blue one is for recycling

Go ahead and put those in there

Yeah

Very good The black one is for all other trash

Do you understand

Yes Which is for burning

No we dont burn trash in this country

Its illegal You never burn trash

Okay can you say that I never burn trash

I never burn trash

Yes What about garbage

mtherfucker

Jared Patakian

You know this Patakian guy is definitely on some end of some spectrum but he is a fullstack engineer

I mean Im sold Jared what do you think

Well hes qualified and he definitely seemed interested

Its a programmers market right now

I think if we like him we should pursue him aggressively

My only concern here and its a small one um hes also named Jared Will it be confusing with two Jareds

If we hire him I can always go back to my real name Donald

No thats too big a hassle Well just go with other Jared

OJ for short

I know a name is just a sound somebody makes when they need you but shouldnt this muchnewer Jared be other Jared

You should be flattered OJ Simpson is one of the most recognizable people on the face of the planet

Was that Jared Patakian I saw exiting the house

Yes we just interviewed him We think hes great

He actually is great I tried to hire him for Aviato

But then he took the offer shopped it around town and got more dough at a different gig

I didnt care for the way that he handled it

So I am going to have to err on the side of caution and say Passadena

Trina

Well Im sorry that that happened to you but you dont get to Passadena on anyone

Weve got to hire a lot of people and he was the only one that we all agree on

But this is my house Im on the board of this company

I mean I must get dings right

Dings

Like in a jury or Whose Line Is It Anyway

Erlich thank you for letting us stay in your house while we figure out what we need officewise Really

But Im sorry You dont get a say in this

Were going to hire the android

Hes a cyborg Richard

The son of a bitch is a goddamned cyborg

Ladies and gentlemen of the press distinguished guests question What is a moonshot

A moonshot is an idea so big so bold as to be impossible until it is not

Magellan circumnavigating

There you are

Sorry I got lost But I think Im supposed to be here

Shh Come on

Not so long ago people called the idea of sending a man to the moon a moonshot

But we did it and that is just the beginning

No idea will be too big for our newest division Hooli xyz

How long do I have to stay here

Cause lunch

And today Im pleased to announce that after some negotiations and armtwisting the brilliant Professor Davis Bannerchek a pioneer in robotics and founder of Somerville Dynamics has agreed to head up this new division

I give you Dr Bannerchek the one and only man fit to be the first head dreamer of Hooli xyz

Also I give you the one and only man fit to be his cohead dreamer our very own Nelson Bighetti otherwise known around here as Baghead Come on up here Baghead

What

He also cofounded Pied Piper right here at Hooli

Im not sure I understand

You are being promoted

Being named cohead dreamer carries with it a significant pay increase

Greater equity more favorable vesting schedule

See but I really liked the job I had

You know I was perfectly happy there

It was kind of the the perfect level of involvement for me I think

And also that other guy Bannerchek

He he did not really seem to like me very much

Oh he does not And he wanted you to know that he moved four schoolaged children and his elderly mother across the country in order to run Hooli xyz on his own

He was very clear about that

And he wanted me to convey that to you

Have I done that

Yeah So what is my job exactly

Oh thats actually thats up to you

You can do whatever you want

Okay See thats sort of what I do now though

But starting today you can do it in a much more significant way

Enjoy your new office

Wait this is my office

Sorry to interrupt The photographers here

The photographer

From Wired magazine for the profile theyre doing on you

Sorry who are you

Your assistant

What

Okay Richard last interview of the day

Uh Dinesh Gilfoyle this is someone you guys recommended I contact Carla Walton Yeah we hung out with her a bunch at the last SF vidtech meetup

Her code is fucking great

She was head of engineering at Earcast

She was engineering at Earcast She pulled that whole system on her own

You know what else excites me here

Theres a distinct overrepresentation of men in this company

Look around I think it would behoove us to prioritize hiring a woman

I disagree OJ We should hire the best person for the job period

And Carla is one of the best

Right let me rephrase

I think having a woman in the company is important but hiring someone only because theyre a woman is bad

I would never compromise Pied Piper

Okay just to be clear our top priority is to hire the most qualified person available right

Of course

But it would be better if that someone was a woman even though the woman part of that statement is irrelevant

Exactly Its like were the Beatles and now we just need Yoko

Thats the worst example you could have used

Im using VP9 ABR to reduce bits and using WebRTC to carry the bulk of the load via p2p

So basically I pay for one tinyass outgoing stream and the users ISP picks up the whole tab

The users pay for all that bandwidth not you

Wow that could save us a ton of money

Yeah a shit ton

And do you think you could integrate it into our platform by January in time for CES

Look Im not going to get in your way

You know you design the engine I just assemble the car

I could have an alpha of that up in a solid weekend of hacking

Wow Cool

Plus I could count on one hand the number of people on earth who could handle sitting in a room with Dinesh and Gilfoyle all day

So

All of that

Plus youre a woman

What

No I just mean we would absolutely love to have a strong woman working here

Im not a woman engineer Im an engineer

Yeah yeah

Okay no no no

No yes of course We want to hire the best people who happen to be women regardless of whether or not they are women That part is irrelevant

Are you doing that interviewing thing where you try to rattle somebody to see if they freak out or not

Uh sadly no This is thats just Jared

I wouldnt know how to do that

Well I am aggressively unemployed right now

So why dont you give me a call when you know what you want to do

Great great

All right

All right Ill show you out

Yeah lucky me

I love The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo

So

So shes actually a badass

Yeah we told you right

We have to hire that person

Are you sh1tting me

You see this Richard What is this

A spoon

Its a wide spoon In fact the only spoon type that is left in this drawer

I specifically posted a note on the refrigerator saying that the more narrow spoons be reserved for the eating for Fage yogurt by me

Look at this the angles all wrong

Arent you supposed to just tip that little plastic cup part up and dump the jam into the yogurt

How would you know that Have you been eating my Fage yogurts

No I saw it on the billboards

Well what they dont tell you on the billboards is that you cant get all of it out look at that

You have to dig it out But you cant dig it out with these bigashell wide fucking spoons

This isnt about the spoons is it Erlich

This is about Jared Patakian

This is about me not letting you tell me who I can or cant hire

Or maybe its about the fact that youre the one whos been using my narrow spoons

Okay

You and I both have to get ready for a board meeting

Can we just stop with the nonsense

Nonsense This is nonsense

Yeah yeah

You know half the yogurts gonna go unused because one quarter of the jam cant come out

Thank you for hosting You have a lovely home

Yeah I do I like this painting

Is it sperm

No three commas

Know what has three commas in it Richard

Uh a sentence with two appositive phrases in it

No a billion dollars

Yeah Im in the threecomma club

You know you play your cards right you could be in the threecomma club too

But probably not But you could be Probably not

What the fuck are you doing

You just cost us 30000

I thought we agreed to present a unified front here

Well if Richard wants a unified front then maybe Richard should do a better job at unifying it

Why are you such a dick

Why are you unable to listen to people who know what theyre talking about

Speaking of Mexico Im supposed to go to Cabo tomorrow but I got roped into buying these two tickets to the Muir Woods preservation thing tomorrow night

Sean Parkers charity Thats a big event

Gonna be a lot of members of the threecomma club there Am I right

Total asshole parade Anyone want these stupid things

Yeah Im down

Uh and Richard no you cant come

But Monica

No

Okay

Babe I said limes limes

Shes honestly so fucking stupid

both chuckling

She doesnt even know what Im saying right now

And until we get real office space I guess we could just put you right here

And we could put Patakian here

I hope you dont mind sitting next to a cyborg

Does he fart a lot and smell like onions

Well he is a coder

Well Id say Im not getting paid enough to deal with this crap but I so am so

You know if its cool Im going to get some stuff out of my car to dump here

I know I dont start till Monday but I want to get it cleaned out before I trade it in

Youre getting a new car

Yeah yeah Mercedes hybrid

Its pretty dope

That sounds expensive

Guys

It is

Uh Richard has something very important to tell you

Yes Ahem so Jared has informed me that as CEO I need to be able to answer any questions that you might have about Pied Pipers harassment policy and workplace code of conduct

Apparently every company our size has to have one of those

Essentially if you find the workplace hostile in any way you can submit a written complaint It will be completely anonymous

Essentially dont do or say anything that might offend anyone

Okay Thank you Thats the policy

Okay

Guys um

This is actually pretty serious

I mean were all cool here but we know each other

So obviously when Dinesh calls me retarded Frankenstein or he describes me as AIDS lady or Gilfoyle refers to me as effeminate KD Lang I know this is a joke among friends

Its not a joke

Were not friends

laughing See its hilarious

But um as we grow were going to be adding a lot of new people to this company and to this office and some of them might not be as amused as I am by such strong language Lawsuits happen

So questions

Oh uh I have a question

Mmhmm

My best friends nickname is Cunty

Im sorry her name is

Cunty

And I was hoping I could call her Cunty while Im here

Okay that ones easy No you cannot

Cause you know I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch and if I cant call Cunty Cunty then its like Im not going to want to have Cunty over at all which I feel like kind of violates my rights

Yeah um it does not as a woman

Okay Im going to have to get back to you on that one

Her best friends nickname is Cunty

Lets maybe get back to the kitchen

Okay

Okay okay

All right I got to clean out my shit box

Nice bag

Thank you

Oh look DG Its like Dinesh and Gilfoyle

Okay that was the third reference shes made to how much money shes making

Hmm

Thats a 3500 bag

How do you know You have the same one

No I have the fucking Internet

You dont think shes making more money than us do you

No we all have equalized pay remember

Yeah me and you and Richard and Jared do but not new hires Its the classic dilemma where the founders make less

We told Richard to get her no matter what it took

Even if she is making more cash than us which she isnt theres no way she has as much equity

You dont know that And Richard wont tell us Its confidential

I guess theres a reason for it

Its so people dont get jealous and throw a hissy fit

Im not jealous I just want to make sure shes making less than me

Hey how do we find out how much shes getting paid here

I have a plan

Hey Carla how much money do you make here

Uh lets just say its a big jump from my old job

Right but you probably got more equity there

Um no actually I get more equity here

What

Yeah Why what are you guys getting

Three points each

Three Thats weird

I thought you got in at the beginning

I have another plan

Erlich All right JianYang dont talk to anybody else

When we get inside dont talk to me

Good evening

Heres the

Thank you

Thank you

And how will you be paying sir

Excuse me

Your donation

Whats your preferred method of payment

Oh no these are already paid for Were guests of Russ Hanneman

Yes he reserved the tickets but you have to pay for them

Oh okay And how much are they

25000

Um so but for both

No no no per ticket

Uh theres no possible way that we could pay that so what do we do here

Well there are a number of other ways to help preserve the Muir Woods

We do a volunteer cleanup program every weekend

Yeah I dont give a shit about the Muir Woods I need to get in there

Sir if you cant pay for the tickets I really dont see how thats possible

What if we do like a little inandout thing

I just go in there 10 minutes you know have one cocktail two three max

He doesnt eat He wont eat Yes Im hungry

Gentlemen Im going to need you to move aside for the other guests

You want me to email Russ Hanneman right now

You dont have Russs email

But I have his I have the phone number of the person who works in his office

Does anybody have an extra ticket My investor cannot pay

Thats actually not true

Uh I think they must have misplaced the tickets

No we have everyones tickets here

Can you please check Erlich Bachman

ERICH

Thats not at all how its spelled here

Lets go Jian

Have a nice night Thank you Next

Excuse me do you have a ticket

God damn it

JianYang come here

Do you have a ticket

Hey JianYang how how was last night

It was sad

Erlich he promised me dinner with a big meat

Big meat

Big meet people

Meet people

Then people say No you cant come in

Wait so you guys didnt get in

We went to Taco Bell

Erlich he started crying in Taco Bell

He tried to blame the taco sauce

Richard

Yes

OJ says you wanted to see me

Yeah

Um I dont want to say this any of this at all but several employees have lodged a complaint against you

For what

Um for making this a hostile workplace

By quote repeatedly rubbing our fucking faces in the fact that Richard Hendricks is a pssy who gave a new hire more than us

Mmhmm Interesting

And which two of the several lodged a complaint

Actually our policy guarantees anonymity so I cant tell you that

Look you and I both know how much you make

Are you fucking with them

Yeah of course Im fucking with them

I bought a fake Dolce  Gabbana bag at a swap meet to piss them off and apparently it did

And I lied and said I was getting a Mercedes

Oh I also left a fake creditcard statement open on my screen cause I thought theyd see it Did they see it

They saw it

Yeah sweet

Carla

Okay all right but what I used to do to fuck with them involved gay prn and Photoshop so I dont think that would be cool after OJs big harassment speech

Huh So in effect the policy worked

Well I can we not do any of it

It just that theyre getting really pissed and its really distracting

All right

No more Cunty

Terrific

Thats really good

Cuntys done

Great But you said it again but maybe thats the last time

Cuntys done Im gonna call you OJ though

Yeah thats fine

Thats for good

Yeah because in my head I change the meaning from Other Jared to Original Jared so now its a compliment

If I have to Im going to keep my fucking Star Blazer

VHS tapes in my room

It doesnt take an IQ of nine to know they should remain alphabetized

I want to watch a specific episode

And its not like theyre on fucking DVD

Hey um Erlich I just want to say this is your house and youve been really cool letting us stay here for all this time and as soon as we get our office space well be out of your way

And how soon is that going to be

Soon

And look I realize its not fair that I bring someone into your house that you dont want here so I will call the cyborg and I will rescind the offer

No Richard Ive been thinking the cyborg is a solid coder

You should hire him Its fine Ill get someone else

Dont be stupid Richard You need a full working beta up in the next few months Just hire the guy

Im not being stupid okay Im not going to hire him

And frankly Im not going to let you bully me into doing it

Would you look at yourself Youre still not fucking listening to me

Im trying to respect you asshole

If you want to respect me then just hire the piece of shit

Dont act like a moron Youre not going to kick Nucleus ass acting like a fucking moron

You dont get to tell me how I respect you okay

I can respect you however the fuck I want

Dinesh Richard You need to come see this

What event could this possibly be used at

Are you happy

Not really

They used the old logo

Do you smell something burning

God damn it JianYang

 All I do is flex I dont need a reason 
 All I want is sx I dont need a reason 
 Fly out on a jet I dont need a reason 
 Every days a neverending summer season 

Background vocals  All eyes on me 
 All eyes on me 
 All eyes on me 
 All eyes on me 
 160 blink and miss me super nifty riding swiftly 
 Rolling through the sticks living extracrispy effortlessly 
 Power steering accurately ready for action actually 
 Mellow relaxed and cocking my snapback 
 Not taking no gddmn backchat 
 Just racking up fat stacks no ring no chain no fat chaps 
 I dont get no sleep no cat naps 
 And everybody want to be on my black sack but I dont slack 
 You dont really want to see me get abstract 
 Ill switch up the place like have that 
 Dont care about none of that rap crap 
 Stay clear of the rat trap some say that I lack tact 
 But Im on the map Im setting the pace Im on track 
 So get out of my face Im on slapping Im on scrapping 
 So stop yakking whats crackalacking 
 Dont follow fashion just keeping it G 
 With these hoes macking and thats whats happening 
 Oh thats whats happening 

Background vocals  Eyes on me all eyes on me
