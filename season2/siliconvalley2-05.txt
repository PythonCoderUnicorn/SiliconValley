sighs

exhales Damn it

Again

Doctor Let me ask you something Richard

You sure its not urine and youre not just wetting the bed

Yeah Im sure Its its not

Its just sweat

Well then the medical term for what you have is night sweats

Okay

But night sweats can be a precursor to bedwetting and that is very serious

How serious

Like uh cancer

No

Its embarrassing

I mean youre a grown man Richard Come on

Thats what children do

But Im not wetting the bed

Yet Hows your stress level been

Uh its gotten worse

Um I have to get a working beta of my platform ready in time for January

I just took money from a guy who is a nightmare

I hired six new people

Were going to spend a ton of money on new offices

Its like every second there is a new issue that I have to solve

I am stressed as hell

Richard currently your stress level is here

And thats nightsweats level

Now if youre not careful and you let it go up bedwetting

theme music playing

Dinesh I love these walls

You know what it is Theyre exposed brick

Why would anyone ever hide brick

Did you see the conference nook

Just think of the conferences we could have in this nook

Oh yeah I mean this is really expensive

So um what did the doctor say

Uh its nothing Its just stressrelated night sweats

Ill be fine

Thats good to hear

Are you relieved

I would have been if that idiot hadnt have mentioned something about how it can lead to uh bedwetting

Im just trying not to think about it

Good dont Definitely

Because just thinking about it would probably stress you out enough to make it happen

Stop

Would you Dont say stress

I just said that I was trying not to think about it

Well Richard personal management is a big part of being a CEO

You think working here might help

Actually uh yeah I think it would

But can we afford it

Well this is an investment in your mental health

Richard I mean can you put a dollar value on not wetting your bed

Ahh dont

If you want this Richard even with the money we wasted on swag and billboards I think I can make the numbers work

Its your call

Hey guys Um this is Yelena

She got off the elevator at the wrong floor because her modeling agency is upstairs

Richard

Yeah

Please

Primarily for other reasons but uh yes Yeah sure Uh were gonna take it

Were take Were taking it

Take Oh

Im gonna hug you

No

All right this ones ready to go out to the truck

Great Take it out

Okay you know what I said we should hire movers

I dont do this kind of stuff

I work with my mind not with my hands

In Pakistan we had servants who did this

It wasnt a big deal We didnt pay them very much and they were very happy

Ill take out your box of tampons

Its good for the soul

Interesting pitch

I will admit I have never heard a Christianoriented riff on dogsharing

But Christianity is borderline illegal in Northern California Also how would you scale

Well we could expand from sharing dogs to other types of pets

Potbellied pigs ferrets

Im gonna stop you right there

You do know that ferrets are illegal in the state of California

Hmm No

Well then I suppose you also dont know that potbellied pigs have been wildly unfashionable since 2005

Owning a potbellied pig is frowned upon almost as much as being a Christian

Thank you gentlemen Good day

And technically Im not passing on Dog Dammit

Im just not saying yes

But who knows The Lord works in mysterious ways

I dont have to tell you that

knock at door

Erlich Richard do you have a moment

Id like to present you something

Okay whats up

What are you doing

Bowing

The Japanese have the most advanced business culture in the world

I am showing you respect by using their traditions

And traditionally you give a gift on important occasions such as the graduating of an incubee

Incubee Is that a word

Of course it is One whos been incubated

The inhabitant of an incubator

Okay Okay

Now you bow Id really rather not

Richard I need you to bow

To the waist

To the waist

Okay

Now I hand this to you and it is customary for you to politely refuse and weakly say that you are not worthy

Erlich I really dont have time for this

Thats perfect Here you go

Good

Oh wow

Japanese coin Lowest denomination

Wow

Is this a kimono

Well try it on

Uh thank you Erlich

Sore wa meiyodeshita

According to Google Translate that means It has been an honor

Yeah all right

Thank you Thanks

Im still packing up so I dont want to damage it

Eh eh traditionally its rolled

Okay

Wikipedia

Thanks Erlich

Ill get you something later

Oh little kohai youve already given me a gift

Hi

Hey

Noah from next door

Oh hey Richard

Moving out

Uh yeah some of us are sort of

Well Id be lying to say I was sad to see you go

Okay Nothing personal

You seem like nice guys just houses full of renters arent great for property values

Yeah that makes sense

This neighborhood is mostly families

Okay Well were moving out so

People with pets you know

Mmhmm

Well good luck

You too

What

You too

Hey Richard

Oh hey Jared

Richard the hosting company that was going to be renting us server space just dropped their bid

Okay well lets just get servers from some other provider

Well I just contacted five other web services companies and theyre all denying us

I think I know what might be happening here

Jared All of them Rackspace Softlayer Amazon

I mean they cant afford to lose Hoolis business

So Gavin Belson can just pick up the phone and make us radioactive to every single webhosting service

Its how these guys operate

I mean when Bill Gates got married on Lanai he rented every helicopter on the Hawaiian islands so that paparazzi couldnt use them to fly over

Although in that case it was a positive because now you can imagine that wedding however you want

What

Dinesh Jared

Our entire platform is webbased

We need servers for that

What the fuck are we going to do

I know what the fuck were going to do

But youre not going to like it

We build our own servers

Gilfoyle servers are essentially a utility

I mean you wouldnt dig a well for water or build a generator for power

I think we should dig our own well and build our own generator

I also think we should store a years worth of food and ammunition in a blast cellar

But we dont

So good luck when the shit hits the fan

Look Richard were about precision about shaving yoctoseconds off latency at every layer in the stack

If we rent from a public cloud were using servers that are by definition generic and unpredictable

Yeah but were already up against a serious deadline

I mean how long is building our own servers going to set us back

If I busted my ass

I could stand them up inside a week right here in the house

Look Richard truth is this is a huge positive

I tried running the platform on my old Bitcoin rig

At 5200 gigaflops your algorithm flies 800 times faster on GPUs compared to normal CPUs

No host could match the config that I built here in the house

Oh and also we dont seem to have a choice

But that would cost a ton

And we dont have that kind of money just lying around

It seems as though we do have that kind of money just lying around

But thats for the office space

Was it

No no no no

Jared we already signed the lease

Its too late right We cant break the lease

I mean we havent given them the check yet

Here it is

I could go mail it right now

In this market they could probably find another tenant in a day

I doubt there would be an issue

fuck Richard please

Its servers or offices Richard We cant afford both

Damn it I dont know what to do

Well then its a good thing

Its a good thing that Im here isnt it

As much as I hate to agree with Gilfoyle hes right You have but one option

Stay here and build the servers

Are you sure Because Ive got Carla and five other coders starting over the next few weeks

Well its going to get a little cozy in here but Ill endure for your sake

What about all your other incubees

Ive heard quite a few exciting pitches over the last week but Ill be forced to forgo those opportunities because of your mediocrity

You see Richard when I invited you into my incubator I promised to get you ready for the outside world

But I failed to do that I wouldnt trust you out there in the real world as far as I could throw you

And to be honest I could probably throw you all the way across the front yard

Okay but I dont want to stay here

I dont want you to either Richard

So its agreed

Welcome home fellas

Should we smoke some pot to celebrate

motors buzzing

Gavin thank you for coming

I am certain that once you witness firsthand what Mr Bighetti is up to you will see that he is worthless around here

Worth is a relative thing

Yes but worthlessness is not It is absolute

People add value to this company in many different ways

Of course but look at this

Bighetti has his team wasting valuable resources on a potato canon

Four three two one

explsin

glass shattering

Heads up

Heads

Bighetti Shit

You see what your brightest minds are being wasted on

Launching potatoes

Bighetti What the fuck

Man Sorry

Perhaps theyre developing it as a nonlethal form of crowd control

I actually think that it could kll somebody

But even so compared to what my team has accomplished in a matter of days I

Come here I want you to meet somebody

All right Ive got a good feeling about this one

One more time Everybody ready Fire

Oh shit You okay Sorry Shit

chirping

Bannerchek This is Kiko

Kiko was rescued after a Nicaraguan landmine severed both his arms

My team using technology developed at Somerville was able to devise an array of sensors that can noninvasively detect signals from the neurons in the motor cortex in the brain

chirping

motors whirring

So without surgery we have given Kiko the gift of a usable prosthetic appendage

whirring

chirping

Whats he doing

Kiko chirping

whirring pulsates

What Kiko chooses to do with the technology is not important

Whats important here is that in spite of what it may seem like on the surface building a device that is capable of this is a remarkable scientific achievement

And what youre looking at is really a testament to my team and to my leadership and I just I feel that

Kiko squeals

Kiko happily chirping

Im going to have to insist that Bighetti be removed if I continue here

Davis there are a lot of forces at work here

Theres a lot at play that you are not privy to

Please do not question how I choose to run my company

Of course I just have to think that both of our interests would be better served if Bighettwas not

What is he doing now

grunting

Oh God

Kiko defecating

Again I have to stress that what the monkey chooses to do with the technology is not necessarily an indictment of the technology itself

Gavin please

Kiko squealing

Oh

Okay So Ill put 80 GPUs on racks against that wall

Well have three main cabinets in the center

Ill try and pull 220volt power from the washerdryer for all the cooling units

So youll need this entire space then

Yep All right

Ill move my things

What

Its okay I travel light Ill have it all in my car in no time

Wait Jared uh are you living here in the garage

Indeed I am High on the hog

Jesus Christ poor fucker Sleeping out there with the rodents

Hey I keep a clean garage There are no rodents out there

How can you guarantee there are no rodents living there when you didnt even know Jared was living there

I need all rodents and Jareds out of the garage

I need the space

Do we have any extra power strips

Theres not a lot of outlets out there




    push

There are a lot of dudes playing foosball loudly

Ill take care of that Say no more JianYang

I need all of your guys out of there and the foosball table

Those not my guys

Theyre always around Who are they

men grunting

Friends of friends

Theyre friends of your Mother fuck

Guys look Jared gave up his own apartment so he could take less salary and save the company money

I mean Erlich can he just stay here

Once again because of your poor managerial skills Ive been hoisted upon my own petard

Yes he can stay here

Great So um which room can he stay in

Well hes not staying in mine

I sleep dickup

Okay so then

Uh not it

Okay

Not a chance in hell

All right Ahem

fuck

Jared speaking German softly

continues speaking German

panting

Oh shit

Morning roomie I made you a halfcaff

Oh

Richard

Yeah

I um I sweated through my sheets again

You sweated You sure you didnt

Yes Im sure Its just sweat so

Do you think maybe you sweat from your urethra

No I didnt sweat through my

You know what Lets not talk about it

Because talking about it will only exacerbate

Stop

Yeah

Hey um when did you learn to speak German

What I dont speak German

You sure

Yeah

All this hardware for 70000

Yup

Its nice work

Oh look at all this stuff

Oh is that a Radeon 7850 Were usinthese huh

Theres no we

You dont do this kind of work remember

You make a living with your mind not your hands

No no no

So dont touch

You misunderstood me I like hardware

I made my own computer when I was nine

From scratch or kit

It was from a kit but I did my own mods

Thats what I thought

I was nine

Im sure you were great at fingerpainting also Dinesh

Richard is the CEO He delegated this to me

Why dont you go inside and write some princess code

Leave the hardware up to us servants

All right I got the crimper and some heat shrink

Great

Wait she can help but not me

Thats right

Can I help Please

Mmm no

I said Richard you have to let me help him

Dinesh you have to hack away on the front end of the build anyway

So why dont you

Excuse me

Excuse me

Oh this is bullshit

Oh hey Noah

I thought you guy were moving up

But it looks like youre moving back in

Well yeah its a little complicated but

What are you guys doing in there

What you building some kind of computer

Well more of a serverdata center

phone vibrating

Its actually pretty interesting if youre into that sort of stuff

Hello

Erlich Stop talking immediately

Come inside Dont look at me Dont look at me

Dont look at me

Just tell him that you shit your pants and have weak knees

What were you doing out there

Oh um

Why were you talking to that person

Cause he lives next door I was just being neighborly

Neighborly First of all thats not a word

Second of all you dont talk to the neighbors ever

In fact dont talk to anybody

Its no ones business what we do here

Why would anyone care what goes on in here

Cause were not zoned for business obviously

What what do you mean were not zoned for business

I just moved my entire business here

You just keep your mouth shut and everything will be fine

You talked me into staying here even though you knew we were breaking the law

Im sorry Erlich but Im pissed

Youre pissed at me

Yeah

I should be pissed at you

You know why

Why

Because when one is given a parting gift and one never parts shouldnt one return the said gift

Isnt that what decorum would dictate

Oh this is out the kimono

Okay I will give it back to you right now gladly

Now Im really pissed

Because if one appreciated a gift of such magnitude then one would put up more of a fight before returning it wouldnt one

Okay okay

Jared A complaint from the neighbor to the Department of Planning and Community Environment triggers an inspection which can lead to a citation fines or even the seizure and impounding of our equipment

That gentleman next door has the power to ruin us

Jesus

Richard can I suggest you take it easy on the Red Bulls

Its a diuretic and given your issue

My issue

Oh God Its night sweats Jared

Yes well regardless of what weve decided on calling it pounding caffeine and sugar is not exactly going to help

But you know what might Kegels

What

Kegels are a form of exercise that strengthen the pelvic floor

Yes its most commonly used by women to recover control of their vaginal muscles after childbirth but it can really help you know night sweats

Wow

Okay were not going to talk about this anymore

Im doing it right now

Clench unclench clench

Stop

music blaring

You hear that

Hey hey

heavy metal blaring

Stop it hey Turn the music down

Turn it turn it off We have neighbors

Are you kidding me Look Gilfoyle you said that you would have all the servers up and running

And were already a week behind

Dont you think you should be doing that instead of you know getting high on the job

Im not getting high on the job

Im getting high at home

I live here remember

Right okay fair enough Fair enough

But Carla doesnt These guys dont

Im having them over as guests at my home

If thats okay with you Richard

This is your home

Yes

You live in the workplace

But you also work from home

That must be really confusing for you

Yes as a matter of fact it is

Thats kind of the

electrical surging

Does it look dark to you guys

Oh hey guys

Dude what the fuck

The powers out

Okay fine I wanted to set up one GPU just one and so I turned the power on and the whole system lit up And

Yeah it did you dick

Cause I bypassed the meter to save money and went directly to the feed without the UPS ready

That surge just fragged the whole fucking system

Holy shit

Erlich What the hell did you guys do

The power in the whole block is down

Great

motor whirring

What the

Oh God look who it is

We need to talk guys

Hold on a sec

No whatever youre going to say just say it from there

We can hear you

If you didnt have so many cars parked here maybe I could get through

Hes really going to go all the way around

Thats a long ways

Hold on

Jesus Christ Save some battery for Christs sake

Just a sec

Just yell it

Its okay Noah we get it You can say it from there

Youre gonna report us to the city inspector right

Erlich Jesus

Guess what

Im reporting you to the city inspector

Right

Zoning codes are very clear

Neighborhoods for families pets

Jared Nicht verstehen

speaking German

Holy shit

screaming in German

Noah Come here Agamemnon Come here boy

Yes Whos a good boy

Yeah youre a good boy

kissing

Come here Agamemnon

Did that blackout scare you Agamemnon

Whos a good boy Whos a good boy

Yeah Give me a kiss Mwah

Oh yeah

Holy shit

Oh yeah Daddy loves you Daddy loves you

Give me a kiss Give me a kiss Oh yeah

knocking

Erlich

What is it

Hey

Um Im sorry I didnt give you back the kimono or resist giving you back the kimono or whatever it was but I have a gift that might make it up to you

Is that what I think it is

Mmhmm

Oh boy

pounding

It is 400 in the morning What the

Why are you both wearing kimonos

Noah are you familiar with the California Fish and Game Code section 21162126 with regard to the possession and harboring of ferrets

Oh God

Oh yeah

Those little shits are illegal

Erlich please dont Ill Ill do anything

Oh yeah you will

We are here to stay and youre going to keep that bearded little hole in the center of your face shut about it

Listen I was just trying

No you listen

Youre always going on and on about how this is such a good neighborhood

Do you know why its such a good neighborhood

Do you know why your shitty house is worth 20 times what you paid for it in the 1970s

Cause of people like us moving in and starting illegal businesses in our garages

All the best companies Apple Google HewlettPackard even Aviato all of them were started in unzoned garages

That is why Silicon Valley is one of the hottest neighborhoods in the world

Because of people like us not because of people like you

So if I catch even so much as a dirty glance or a lascivious look in Richards direction that is it

Those weasels are dog food

Okay Okay

whispering

Um guest house

Yes Is your guest house currently rented out

No its not for rent

Well it motherfucking is now

Your new tenant is Jared Dunn

His rent will be exceedingly reasonable

And his utilities will be included

electrical buzzing

He speaks German in the night

Well if youll excuse us we have an illegal business to run

Erlich

grunts

But when our scientists did the study they found the rate of birth defects in that territory was actually higher before we opened our battery plant there

But very good question Thank you for that question

Okay before I finish up here I have an announcement

Today I have accepted the resignation of Dr Davis Bannerchek

So it pleases me to inform you all that effective immediately Nelson Bighetti has been promoted to sole head dreamer of Hooli XYZ

Sorry what

Stand up Bag Head

What a meteoric ascension

Just a few months ago you cofounded Pied Piper and now youve been promoted twice

It speaks to your competence

Give it up for Bag Head ladies and gentlemen

And lastly I have big news

In anticipation of our big release of Nucleus at CES in January weve decided to give the world a sneak preview

Nucleus in partnership with Dana White and the Ultimate Fighting Championship will be the exclusive provider of live streaming for next months Ultimate Fighting Championship event Molina versus Bulgakov II

I realize the full platform wont be ready until January but our Nucleus division assures me they are ready for this challenge

And I can think of no more exciting a way to give a little taste of Nucleus to the entire world than by putting video latency in a rearnaked choke hold

Great job team All right back to work

Did you uh tell Gavin where we are on the video situation

He does know thatonverting the whole platform to middleout has put us at least six weeks behind schedule right

Well Im not going to be the one who tells him were that far behind If you want to feel free

I just heard you tell Heidi wersix weeks behind

But remember that dropframe issue I showed you

Were easily 15 weeks behind

Well Im not going to be the one to tell Heidi about that

Feel free to tell her yourself

Did I just hear you say were only 15 weeks behind

Ive been integrating the system natively

Dude I dont even want to know about it

 My life   Your life   Dont cross them lines   What you like   What I like   Why cant we both be right   I dont wanna fight no more I dont wanna fight no more   I dont wanna fight no more I dont wanna fight no more   I dont wanna fight no more I dont wanna fight no more   I dont wanna fight no more I dont wanna fight no more
