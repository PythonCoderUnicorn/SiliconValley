How can Gavin Belson claim that he owns Pied Piper

I mean this whole lawsuit is insane right

Well let me ask you something Richie

And I need you to be totally straight with me

Was Pied Piper related in any way to what you were doing when you were working at Hooli

No No not at all I was doing quality assurance for mobile messaging

It had nothing to do with compression

They didnt even have a compression division at that time

And did you work on Pied Piper on Hooli time or use Hooli equipment to develop it in any way at any time Richie

No and no

Great And by the way always tell me that and tell yourself that

Because if you believe it a jury will too

Oh I I do believe it Its the truth

Great That one was even better than the other one

I love it Always say it exactly like that

Yeah okay Look

sighs Were going to win this right

Richie if what you just told me is the truth

And dont tell me if you lied

Gavins got nothing here

This is a classic intimidation lawsuit designed to freeze you until after Nucleus comes to market

Its got all the usual boilerplate nonsense

Breach of contract unjust enrichment

breach of nonsolicitation in the hiring of someone named Donald Dunn

Jared We call him Jared

Changing his name to get out of it clever but irrelevant because all we care about are the intellectualproperty claims

And we will win this

Good but were going to have to lawyer up

What do you mean Arent you our lawyer

Im not a litigator Thats what you need

Another lawyer Really

Lawyers Richie You dont want to mess around here

A young startup with an IP lawsuit hanging over its head

laughs I wouldnt want to be a part of that team

Well but you are a part of that team

Im part of the team that team is on

Yeah Its It just sounds really expensive

Says the guy who just got bukkaked with fat term sheets

Welcome to the business Richie

Look wherever were at with your funding legal fees will be worked into the deal

Youve got Raviga Youre covered

Relax

Were out What do you mean were out

Was it not clear from the context

We at Raviga are out of the business of funding Pied Piper at least while the Hooli lawsuit remains unresolved

That suit is total nonsense

Nonsense is not a quantifiable metric Monica

Risk is

Funding any earlystage company is a highrisk proposition but compound that uncertainty with a legal cloud over the companys intellectual property and its untenable

And that is just the financial risk There is also a legal risk

We could become embroiled in Gavin Belsons lawsuit for aiding and abetting

And there is a political risk for the firm but especially for me as its new leader

Im being heavily scrutinized from both within and without

I cannot have my first decision postPeter be one with such dubious fundamentals

Its a rudimentary decision

How am I supposed to tell them this

In my experience its best to look a person in the eye and deliver the information with warmth and compassion

Okay

One other suggestion

Dress unattractively when you tell them

I read a study The less sexual interest they feel for you the less perturbing it will be It sounds strange but its credible

May I suggest the The beige ensemble in which you came to work Tuesday

Things are just really different at Raviga and I had nothing to do with the decision

Guys Im so so sorry

Wait so the company that offered us the most until Richard talked them into offering us the least is now offering us nothing

But the fact that youre so sorry makes it all better

You guys will be fine Youll find someone else

We dont want someone else Monica The whole point of going with you guys was because we trust you guys

Trusted

We still have our 5 stake and Laurie said that I can still sit on the board which means I can still come to meetings

Can I say something here

First off Monica youre not fooling any of us for even a second with your dressshitty toeasethepain routine

Its a classic chick breakup move and youre not very good at it either You look great

Yeah beige is a good color for you

Youre a true autumn

Secondly who cares

We have a threefoot stack of term sheets from the top VCs on the face of the planet

So the top one fell out As Jay Z says on to the next one

Jared whos our next best offer

Uh between the numbers and the reputation that would be Coleman Blair Partners

Im gonna go put my face on

Call Coleman Blair Tell them that Santa Claus is coming early this year and hes bringing a big bag of Pied Piper

Well Im going to leave this room without saying goodbye to you

Im sure you can find your way out with one of your two faces

Sorry about that

The guys are just a little emotional

No I I get it

And look I probably shouldnt say this but there are a lot of really great VCs in town

Youll be fine

I just

Just what

Just tell them that youre really excited to be in business with them and try to close quickly

You know while momentum is still on your side

theme music playing

Well its gonna break a lot of hearts on Sand Hill Road but congratulations

We decided to go with you

Uh we were told that you were going with Raviga

And I am happy to say that is no longer the case

Were really excited to be in business with you guys

Can I ask Did you walk away from them or did they walk away from you because of the lawsuit

Ah that lawsuit we know to be frivolous

Yeah

Is that a yes folder

No

So no pastries today huh

So both Raviga and Coleman Blair Partners passed because of the lawsuit

Frivolous suit Its nothing

 Well its not nothing

Look before we start negging each other

Negging

Its a term used in sexual manipulation

Maybe not relevant here

Were really excited to be in business with you guys

Hmm

We actually see this lawsuit as a positive

We will win and it proves that we have something worth suing over

And yet Raviga Coleman Blair Partners and Wood Opal Fund have all passed

Were really excited to be in business with you guys

Hmm

music stops

You know term sheets arent legally binding documents right

Of course not Theyre just guidelines that people follow unless of course theyre pussies

You came in here three days ago

You were arrogant condescending and offensive

Now you come in here you call me a pssy

Whoa whoa I did not call you a pssy

I said that people who break termsheet agreements are pussies and that hasnt happened yet

Thus I havent called you a pssy yet

Youre in control of the situation

Hooli has the unlimited resources to hamstring you until Nucleus comes out at which point they will be the market standard and you will be irrelevant

Were here to invest in innovation not lawyers so let me be perfectly honest with you

Your behavior was boorish and juvenile

You were rude vulgar and uncouth

You were course graceless and puerile

Obscene insulting and ignorant

Ignorant

You called me a shitriddled al wasteland

You called me a chode gargling fucktoilet

Were really excited to be in business with you guys

Uh guys I hate to panic you until Im absolutely sure its warranted but Richard just texted me We got our seventh pass

fuck

fuckin Gavin Belson

All the VCs turned on us

Apparently Erlich used some pretty assertive vaginal metaphors last round so its been a bit of an uphill climb

I think were going to have to crunch our burnrate again

Even with the 50000 from TechCrunch were not going to last very long

Wait wait wait No no no

Richard said we were going to split that money right

10000 each

I dont think we can afford to do that anymore

fuck

I just donated 5000 to my cousin Wajeeds Kickstarter campaign

Hes trying to get an app called Bro off the ground

Bro

Its a messaging app that lets you send the word bro to everyone else who has the app

So its exactly like the Yo app

Yes but less original

Why dont you just cancel your credit card

That way Kickstarter cant collect your pledge

Well I would love to but he looks up to me

I was always like the cool cousin of the family You know what I mean

Wait Did you just say you were the cool cousin

Yeah

Please explain

Well when we were kids I was the one getting good grades I was the one who was planning for my future

I would bring gifts for my teachers cause they worked so hard

You know cool stuff He was always getting in trouble he got caught smoking opium in the tool shed he crashed my uncles motorbike

And you think youre the cool one

Yeah its different in Pakistan

Ive never been but I know it isnt

Oh here it is Bro to Bro is a onebit communication messenger the fastest way to speak your mind

As long as whats on your mind is the word bro

Well hes still shy of his goal

If he doesnt get there none of the pledges get collected

I feel horrible for what Im about to say but I really hope he fails

That is the first cool thing youve ever said

phone buzzing

You know what This may not be an issue

Richard and Erlich are heading into their last stop

I trust Erlich can be diplomatic and pull it off

A few days ago I came in here I did some things and said some things that I should not have

Also we would like to be open about the fact that Pied Piper is involved in a complicated legal matter that could affect our potential value

And that being said we are open to renegotiating the funding terms to reflect that

But most of all I want to thank you

Thank you for allowing me to come in here today and be vulnerable and to apologize

scoffs Mr Bachman I didnt have you come all the way back here today just to apologize to me

Uh please its Erlich And you didnt

Of course not I I asked you back because three days ago I sat right here and I watched you put your testes on this reclaimed Brazilian Koa wood table and now youre going to sit there and youre going to watch me do the same gddmn thing to you

What What

My turn

No but its your table

Yes it is my table

Richard Oh man Please dont do that

Erlich Good god

I think you should cancel your Kickstarter campaign

Whoa what

Listen I love your idea

You know I do right bro

Yeah Bro

Bro Like it lets you send the word bro to anyone else that has the app

I know what it is Youve explained it to me so many times

I love it but you know Im not saying

Other people are like saying horrible stuff

Im supporting you and theyre saying like Oh he couldnt get funding so he had to go to Kickstarter like some charity case collecting money from strangers like a street beggar who sits on the ground eats trash

Really

Yeah

Look just between us I was thinking about canceling anyways because were way way under our goal

Really Really

Like embarrassingly low

Hmm You know what

That sucks

It does really suck

But I think its the right thing to do

Well youre right

Cause you dont want bad word of mouth to kll such a great idea

Yeah like with what happened to your app Yeah

What do you mean what happened to my app

Everybody started talking about how bad it was and you ended up giving up

I didnt give up I left to go work on Pied Piper

So youre saying then that if Pied Piper didnt happen you would still be working on your app

Even though all those people just shit like all over

Like all of them speaking Urdu

You know what Youre right youre right Thats what makes you so cool that you have the fucking backbone to say that

fuck those people

Yeah fuck em all

fuck those people

fuck them

Im not going to cancel my Kickstarter campaign fuck em

Wait hold on one second

Yeah no you know what Youre right fuck them




    push

Im not going to cancel it and Im going to throw a huge Kickstarter party

Im gonna invite everyone that I know and were going to put Bro over the top

Everybody this guy is the coolest cousin

Thank you for the 5000 eh laughs Whoo

At least I have the common decency to shave mine

Before you pull them out in public

So youre complaining about the guys sense of decorum

Absolutely We live in a society

I cant believe we are this fucked

Guys something interesting just happened

So I downloaded Wajeeds Bro app out of curiosity and found it very sticky

Ive never felt like I was anyones bro before

The only people who have used that term with me were assailants but um I started broing people and getting broed back

This is my nightmare

And all of a sudden Im bros with all kinds of people including a guy from Branscomb Ventures

Branscomb Thats a solid shop

Yes So we broed about this and that and then when he heard I worked at Pied Piper he got excited he tripleliked my bro and asked about meeting us

Okay but does he know about the lawsuit

Yeah I told him I mean you know what they say Bros disclose No one says that

Wait doesnt Branscomb already have its own compression play

Yeah but not a good one apparently

I mean they want to sit down with all of us engineers included

That only happens in a second or third meeting

Technical due diligence Thats good

Okay Jared what What did you tell him

Um I was waiting a bit to bro him back so that I dont seem overeager

Bro him back Bro him back

Bro him

Were not dead yet guys

Well get some sleep my bros

Ill set the meeting and um then Ill go find some hoes to prioritize behind you

Are you trying to say Bros before hoes

Its sexist but its about friendship

Middleout is based on a completely new probabilistic model

It finds longrange structure thats hidden even to domainoptimized algorithms

Im sorry is Is this too in the weeds

Not at all Take us into the weeds

Wouldnt you rather hear our gotomarket strategy

You mentioned something earlier about stacking middleout on top of another compression algorithm

How does that even work

I mean you cant compress something thats already compressed to entropy

Right

Wow

Uh I dont really get too many of those questions in meetings like these

But uh its actually easier if I if I show you

May I

Absolutely

Okay great Here here I go

Stacking middleout is actually very real

Lets take

Do you have to pee Jared

Because I have to pee

Richard So when you unpack

I would love to pee

Down to the symbolic level

There When you stack middleout

Theyre brainraping us right

They definitely are

Shit All right wait here

door opens closes

What are you doing

I told you I didnt have to go pee What is happening

Those guys are never going to fund us We need to leave now

What are you talking about This is going great

I mean VCs are never interested in how middleout actually works

Of course theyre interested because they want to steal it

This is a classic brainrape

What

We did it at Hooli all the time

Wed schedule meetings with companies so theyd explain their technology then wed use their ideas in our products

Like what happened to Yelp

Yes

Its like when somebody says they want to go birding with you but really they just want to get you alone in the woods so they can take your binoculars

Look those guys arent doing technical due diligence

Theyre not even consultants Theyre a compression company

One of them has braces for fucks sake

Braces Shit

Dinesh and Gilfoyle are still in there

Middleout doesnt restrict itself to H264s twodimensional grid or timebound patterns at all

This is great Great

You know they usually dont bring us to these things and I think I know why

Its cause we steal the show

snaps You guys are really helpful

All right shut it down Meeting over Were out of here

No more pictures assholes

I could email you Why is this not coming off

No youre not emailing anybody

clanging Damn it Jared

We were bros We were bros

Wajeed Yo yo yo just want to thank everyone for coming out to this Kickstarter party for Bro the app that proves that you can change the world in just one word applause

Actually its just half a word

I know Its so efficient

As you can see were just 5000 away from our goal

But we got a whole hour left people

So lets get those bronations going

Donations are funny right

I mean why would anybody donate to something like Bro and not a homeless shelter or schools

Cancer Thats still out there

Any of us could have it

Food for thought which a lot of people also dont have

Have a great party guys

You could donate if you want but hes throwing away half the worlds market

You know what bro means in Mandarin

It means asshole

You know what bro means in Portuguese Rapist

In Latvian it roughly translates to one who beheads the messiah

In Finnish bro means a babys erection

In Urdu bro is actually short for speaks Urdu which means a dildo for a man

A mans dildo

Fecal eclipse

It loses something in translation

We dont have a word for it They do

Its bro

You know what bro means in Navajo

A really joyful person with mental disabilities

All right less than a minute to go people

And were just two grand away Come on you can do it come on

dings Thats that Im talking about

500 from GilfoyleunderscoreLuci4

Where you at bro wherever youre at youre my bro

sighs

Looks like I got here just in time bro

What the fuck did you do that for Do you know how this works

If you put him over the edge we both owe him money

But you have to pay a lot more

Wajeed 30 seconds left Im effectively leveraging your misery

Somebody Anybody Im like the Warren Buffett of fucking with you

1100 Come on bros Youre a dick

Only 1100 left I might be good for that

Gilfoyle please

Ill tell you what

You pay me 500 and I wont pledge anymore

For 500 bucks you save 5000

Im not giving you a dime

Nine eight seven

Okay Im pledging

No Stop Let me

Stop it 500 It costs 500 500

Okay

Three two

It doesnt matter Its not like hes going to make his

dinging alarm blares

What the fuck

Yes yes yes We did it Who was it

Thats not how that was supposed to go

Mika Mika I love you you Mika

all cheering

Who is that tall Asian woman

Some woman that Wajeed is fucking

She was in the Olympics

Huh

He really is the cool cousin

Even with the 50 grand we got at TechCrunch weve only got a few weeks left of runway before we crash and burn

Richard if it makes you feel any better I put that Branscomb guy in his place

I dropped him from Bro but not before I sent one final angry bro

What do you mean You can make them angry You can make bros angry

Well he made this bro angry

But technically no The bro I sent was identical to the previous bros I sent but I think hell infer the anger from context

phone buzzing This is Ron on the phone I gotta take it

Yeah okay beeps

Hello Ron

Hey Richie

I gotta bounce on over to my mindbody thing but I just wanted to give you the good news

I got you a topshelf litigator

Yeah uh we should probably discuss that

Youre gonna sweat me about the cost right Dont

I hammered them on their fee Theyre going to bring it way down

Okay so how much

This whole thing is going to cost you 2 25 million tops

What

I know right Its like its free

I told you I pay for myself

So Im going to need you to head on down to their offices tomorrow at 1000 AM You slap an 80K retainer on them and we are good to go

call waiting beeps Oh shit

I okay I actually have another call so

Ill get out of your pubes

Im emailing you intros to the guys youre meeting tomorrow

Later

beeps

Hello

Oh uh hello

Yes uhhuh

Sure just me



Okay what time

Hello

Richard Thanks for coming

clears throat sighs

What are we doing Richard

Lawsuits and lawyers

You out there getting rejected by every VC in town

Neither of us want this but maybe together we can find a way out

Yeah easy Drop the lawsuit

You know I cant do that I didnt steal Pied Piper from you and you know it

Well thats up to the courts to decide

And until they do youre frozen

Meanwhile my best engineers are working around the clock to get me a middleout algorithm that surpasses yours

And in January when we have it and we come to market you wont just be frozen youll be dead

You played your best hand Richard and you lost

Its just business So wouldnt you rather get something out of Pied Piper while you still can

Let me acquire you

What No way Are you kidding me

We should have just done this the first time

I know you thought about it Its the perfect fit

You get my infrastructure I get your speed and I get it today rather than in a month or two

Whats the downside

The downside is that everything Im building becomes the property of your giant soulless corporation

And what exactly do you think youre building

Youre out there trying to get funding so you can hire people scale up roll out a product IPO and eventually become a publiclytraded what

Corporation

We would be different

I see I suppose once Pied Piper is a billiondollar company youll seek out your competitors and help them

Please Lets face it

What is Hooli if not the best possible future version of Pied Piper

You think youre building something different No

Youre building something thats exactly the same as what Ive already built except with you instead of me but thats not possible now Richard

But you know what is We could build something together you and me

Something great Something the world needs now

Look I dont have to do this

Im just trying to do the right thing here

So what do you say

You want to know what I say

deep sigh

Okay heres what I say

mariachi band playing

singing in Spanish

singing continues

light instrumental music

Music fades
