Richie

Right on time

Hey Youre the lawyer

Ron Laflamme Great to meet you

Grunts

All right homeboy Pop a squat

Start autographing by the flags

Lot of paper to get through

So what do you think

About

Jeannie Shes pretty hot right

Oh Yeah No shes Shes very pretty

Yeah she is

Oh were doing that Ok

Chuckles

So yo Peter tells me youre popping your cherry with this

So let me just walk you through it

That stuff youre signing gives you the convertible note for funding and establishes you and Peter Gregory as the board members of Pied Piper incorporated in the State of Delaware

Ok Why Delaware

Rich Rich Lawyer not lawyer I got you

So Peter Gregory big fan of you

Oh

He invited you to his toga party right

Thats a big deal Flo Ridas gonna be there

You like Flo Rida

Should be fun

Yeah I went to a lot

See this guitar

Sergei and Larry from Google signed it

Both of them Right there

Mmm Mm

Strums offtune

So Pied Piper

Youre one of Peters compression plays huh

Uhh one of How many does he have

Not too many Like six or eight

Ok Why are there so many

You know how sea turtles have a shitton of babies because most of them die on their way down to the water

Peter just wants to make sure that his money makes it to the ocean

But it seems like you got your shit together

A lot of these guys come in here and they can do all of the engineering stuff but they get all hung up on technicalities

They cant just tell you what their vision for the company is

Those guys are so fucked

Its like you need both halves of the brain right

The Jobs and the Wozniak The ying and the yang

Oh I think its yin

Yin Chuckles

Yeah

Like yin and yan

No Like yin and yang

No Its ying and yang theyre opposites

So Pied Piper drop it on me What is it

Well we started off as a music app

Yuck

Yeah Gross Ugh

Awkward chuckle But weve uh weve pivoted since then

Uhoh To what

Well our weissman scores are consistently high across all media audio video metadata

Actually thats not true Weve had some trouble encoding 3D video

I think its because the pixels change value differently than conventional

Playing guitar through amplifier

Just look at the flow diagram dude

No the filter bank is part of the prediction loop

What are you talking about this is lossless compression

Oh hey Big Head you were there

Why did Richard use a DCT filter bank

Oh Um

Not really sure Richard tried to explain some of this stuff but a lot of it I didnt really understand so Id kinda just nod and smile you know

Can you at least help us figure out this insane DFT spider web hes using

Chortles

Dude do you understand any of this

Chuckles

I eat the fish

I understand you eat the fish

But when you clean the fish you cant leave the fish head and guts and shit in the sink

Because the whole house smells like a bait station

So you gotta put it in the trash and then take the trash out

Do you understand

Yes I eat the fish

Motherfuck

Do you know how awkward it is to not be able to describe your own company

Like I built Pied Piper and you could see it but I cant really describe to you what it is even though I kind of know where Im going

You do realize we quit working on our own apps to work for you right

Shouldnt you more than Kind of know where youre going

Because thats basically what the CEO does

I do Sort of

Richard Ok its like trying to tell someone how to get somewhere even though you dont really know the exact address Right

Like how do you do that Because you cant just say Go to 415 elm street because you dont even know what that is Right

So you have to say you know Go straight down that big road and take a right at the weird thing

But you cant describe what that weird thing is because you just know it as a weird thing you know in your head You always have

Is that weird thing in your head an aneurysm

Richard Im just gonna recap for a second um you turned down ten million dollars to be able to develop something that you as the head of the company cant even describe to another human being

I say this only to motivate you

Ok so I have been instructed to remove you from the list of employees assigned to the Nucleus project

You will no longer receive any Nucleus related communications uh file reports or attend any Nucleus meetings

Any questions

Uh no Thats Thats pretty clear

Great

Am I being reassigned to something else

Not that I am aware of At this time No

Wait so then am I being fired

Because I have a three year contract and my stock options

Ok Whoa whoa whoa Nobody is being fired Ok

Look a contract is a contract

You know Youve got a contract And Ive got a contract We all have contracts

Andand here at Hooli contracts are honored

Um yours and mine

Everybodys So um

Have I made that perfectly clear

Yeah no Thats clear

But when I come into work tomorrow what do I do

That is unclear At this time



Chatter

Shoulda worn more than my underwear and a bed sheet

Underwear pssy

Yeah Im with him

This is the type of evening that requires freeballing

Oh Im gonna take my underwear off too

Richard Hey you made it

So Peter met with Laflamme today and signed the paperwork which means Pied Piper is officially launched

Uh why didnt you tell me about all the other compression plays Peter was seeding

What No because its nothing you need to worry about

Because none of those other companies have your vision

My vision

Exactly

Speaking of which Peter really wants you to come in on Friday to chat about big picture stuff

You know lay out your vision in broad strokes

Broad strokes For the vision of the

Uhhuh

Well uh Pied Piper is compression and we all know that

So we dont need to talk about that but I could because Im the CEO

Whispers Oh no

Plus we have this for the Pied Piper documentary that were eventually gonna make

Sighs

Are you dressed like Steve Jobs

Well I suppose Steve and I always have shared a similar aesthetic

Whistles Hey Little help

Oh Ok

Grunts

Hacky sack hits wall

Here you go

Thanks man

Sorry about the throw Bursitis

Uh so you guys having a meeting up here

Quiet laughter

No Not exactly

Were all currently unassigned

How about you

Yeah Unassigned

Yeah

Chuckles

Thats cool

Man Yeah

How could you put Erlich on the board

What were you thinking

You dont put someone inside the company on the board

Then he and Peter Gregory can vote you out

Yeah You gotta find an outsider you trust Like your mom

Id put Erlich on the board before my mom Backstabbing bitch

Guys I was drunk ok

You know I halfjokingly said to Gilfoyle last night

It looks like Richard is going to suck Erlichs dick

But that would be reasonable compared to this

Richard um could I speak to you

Ok Yeah

Hes the least cool guy Ive ever met

I heard about whats been happening

I have to say Im a little disappointed

Yeah I dont I dont know what I was thinking

Yes I mean um is there a reason I wasnt invited to the party

Is there some sense that Im not part of the gang

What Uh Jared

Of course not It was just an oversight

I mean we werent even sure if we were gonna go

Uhhuh And what was it like there

Were there gelatin shots

No No uh it was stupid and loud

Uh honestly youre better off

I suppose I had a fine night

I I had some palak paneer and I watched a documentary about Liberia

But then I woke up to this um unexpected development

Do you do you really want Erlich on the board

Because Ill support you

No I dont At all

I was just drunk

I dont know how to get out of it

I mean what am I going to say to Peter Gregory

Well if you dont sign the documents and you dont give them to Peter Gregory then it wont happen Simple as that

Really I Wow Ok

Sighs That is a relief Jared Thanks

Im Im glad youre around

Well keep that in mind for future parties

Chuckles

Honestly sometimes we forget youre here

Oh

Erlich You guys company photo time out back Lets go

Uh Gilfoyle ok off to the center a little bit

Like your personality No no no no

Dinesh leave it unbuttoned We want you to look like shit

Makes for a better before photo

But youre wearing a jacket

Yeah because Im the genius marketer

Im not a code freak like you guys

Besides Im wearing sandals so I am iconoclasting a little bit

Oh good Jared Ugh What the fuck is with that vest

Right over here As if youre sort of a late addition that may not stick around for the entire duration of the company

And then Richard There you go The man of the hour

Ok Well take a few like this and then Just Richard and I

Because at the end of the day people only want to see a picture of the board members

It Actually its um

Youre not gonna be a board member

What

Camera beeping

Camera clicks

Im in year three of a five year deal and Matt you got what like three years left

Yeah We all got acquired by Hooli when we didnt work out none of us got reassigned

Because Gavin believes in this Japanese form of management where not being assigned is the most shameful outcome

Laughter

Yeah it does feel uncomfortable

Nah Give it a week or two youll get like numb to it

Well why are you guys still coming in

Rest and vest

Oh because in order to fully vest your options youve gotta wait until your contracts are up

I get it

You catch on slow

Youll fit right in here

Lunch Arbys on El Camino Ill drive

No lets walk Itll take longer

Gotta do something to fill the day right

I was drunk You took advantage of me

Man they are really going at it

Erlich continues yelling

So um last night what was the girl situation

Shhh

And after all Ive given up for this company

Oh what have you given up

I owned ten percent of Dineshs app ten percent of Gilfoyles app

Multiple potential streams of income

Sure

Not to mention that a hundred percent of the team that you have were all guys that I recruited for this house

That must be worth something to me

It is Ten percent of Pied Piper

For which I forewent yes thats a real word one million dollars

Mmm

I supported you Richard I bet on you

And now youre just gonna give me a seat on the board only to retract that offer

I cant even remember doing that

Oh really Well do you remember this particular dickbag I got on video

Sighs

Because you did

Put it away

Its right here

Goddammit

Ive seen the video

Its the wrong album just give me a sec

You know what fuck it You offering me a position on this board and reneging it is a perfect example of you having no vision no balls and no game

Maybe he did blow him

Well love and hate Its all passion

Erlich continues yelling

And if thats the kind of company you wanna run well then fine

God help you Cause I sure as hell aint

Uh what are you doing

You give your loyalty to somebody

Let me help you

Dont touch

I can do it myself

All right

I just put it back on Goddammit

Ok Read that back to me

Pied Pipers mission is to bring its unique compression algorithm to a variety

One thing you should know about living in this house is I do not tolerate substance abuse

Theres no drinking and lying in this house

I should have made that more clear to some of the current residents

Like this one Dont mind him

Hell be gone soon when his company cakes its pants

Hopefully Jurgen youll be able to bring a more positive element to the house

Let me show you the room Im offering Some of his stuff is still in there but as I mentioned it will soon be gone

Once his company cakes its pants

Its ok Just take a breath

Its fine Im fine Uh we just

Lets get through this Ok so read this back to me

Pied Pipers mission

Hey guys

Hope you dont mind the front door was just open

Hi Big Head Whats up

Honestly Nothing Ive just been sitting around all day

Not working Its weird you know

Sighs

Yeah

So whats up with you guys

Rattling

Were just sort of

Were getting ready for this big Peter Gregory meeting

And we have we have a lot of work to do so

Cool Very cool

Rattling continues

You know Richard the irony is that if you had taken the ten million youd be kicking back with a ton of money right now and Id still be working

But you didnt obviously And now Ive got nothing to do Im rolling in it and youre working your ass off

Lifes funny isnt it

You guys want to walk to Arbys maybe grab a bite play a little hacky sack

Yeah I should probably get back to work anyway

I mean not work exactly I dont

I dont work But you know just get back to Hooli

Sit around all day and get paid a bunch of money to do nothing

Chuckles Weird

You ready

Sighs

You know what youre going to say You want to run it by me

No no I got this fuck Erlich

You know I turned down ten million dollars to build this thing

You want vision I will show you fucking vision

I like this new angry side to you

Being around angry people relaxes me because I know where I stand

Sucks teeth

Oh shoot I think I got something stuck in my teeth

Im just gonna go to the bathroom check it out Ill be back in a sec

Richard its Jared Are you ok

Door unlocks

Water running

Hey buddy whats going on here

I thought I had something in my teeth but when I looked over right I looked in the mirror like this uh my pants they hit the countertop and it must have some water on there right

So I got a spot on my pants kinda looked like I pissed myself like a big baby

So what I did was I just took off all my pants and I put it in the water just to make it all completely wet

You know that way I figured no one would really notice

So you know it wouldnt be as bad Ive got it under control

Ive sorted it out Were good

Yes So you felt this wouldnt look as bad

Understood

Yeah

But Richard Um

Consider that maybe this might not be the best choice for the meeting

Yeah Holy

What the fuck am I doing

I cant go like this to the meeting

Jared I have no vision

Yes you do

I believe in you

No no I literally have no vision

All I see is stars and swirls I cannot see right now

Ok lets get your pants on

Knock on door

Monica Jared Richard Are you in there

Ohh

Hey theres some weather over the ocean so Peter would love to get started Are you guys ready

Yep All good Be there in a jiffy

Ok

Richard Oh

Jared Im on a carpet in a bathroom

Yeah ok Um I know this isnt the best thing to say to someone having a panic attack but we need to hurry here

Doing ok

Yes much better

Nope Worse

Richard youre gonna listen to me if you know whats good for you

Erlich

I may have been wrong about being a board member and I may be wrong about being the Steve Jobs in our relationship

But I do know this you are the Steve Wozniak

And no Woz should go into a meeting like that alone

No Actually

So if youll just let me come in then I wont speak

And I just think you should have somebody in there who will actually have your back

Ok No I Erlich I want you to be in there

Ok wait what

Yes and I need you to do all the talking

Because I feel like if I do Im gonna puke all over Peter Gregory

Oh ok Wow

That was easier than I All the talking

Oh Erlich youre here too

Ok Come on in guys

Um Im going to stay here I think

Because I look absurd

Yeah Yeah ok

So what are you going to say

fuck I dont know

Sighs

Water dripping

Todays user wants access to all of their files from all their devices instantly

Thats why cloudbased is the holy grail

Now Dropbox is winning but when it comes to audio and video files they might as well be called Dripbox

Chuckles

Using our platform Pied Piper users would be able to compress all their files to the point where they truly can access them instantly

We control the pipe they just use it

Thats the vision in Richard Hendricks head

Sure

Sounds fine

Oh I received an email from Ron Laflamme saying that this gentleman is going to be our third board member

Uhh

Yes Yes

Uh Erlich helped me with all this stuff Hes very talented

I need him as a partner

Fine

Its ok for you to leave now

All right ok

Wait is that you and Gavin Belson

Yes Its an old photograph

Were you guys friends

I thought so

Goodbye

Howd it go

Shoes squishing

That was amazing I mean that was like everything in my head but like clear

Did you just make that up on the spot

Yeah We should probably write some of it down

Yeah Well look I gotta be honest I mean I cant tell you how much this means

You really saved my ass even after I was such a dick to you

Youre making up

What else could I do Richard

Youre my Wozniak

And I will always be

Groans
