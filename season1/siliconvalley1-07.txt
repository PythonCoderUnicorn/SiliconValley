snickering

Whats up

You know I wrote that code right

Let me hear it Disrupt

mild applause

Man Disrupt

Hello My name is Saeed Jobrani

I am the CEO of ImmediBug

And were here to revolutionize the way you report bugs on your mobile platform

Happin will revolutionize locationbased mobile news aggregation as you know it

Were making the world a better place through paxos algorithms for consensus protocols

And were making the world a better place through software defined data centers for cloud computing

A better place through canonical data models to communicate between endpoints

A better place through scalable faulttolerant distributed databases with asset transactions

And we are truly local mobile social

And were completely SoMoLo

And were MoLoSo

Were LoMoSo bro

We were SoLoMo but now were MoLoSo

No MoSoLo No

vomiting

You want me to get a water or something

Yeah drink this

Here

So were all good

Were all great

I klled it Our Weissman score on all tests 289

Right at the theoretical limit

Yeah all the edge modules are humming

Uh even on mobile They can throw anything at us

Great Well good luck Im gonna go find my seat

Um except 3D video

What

3D videos still a little hinky

Erlich better steer them away from that just to be safe

Where the hell is Erlich

He wasnt with you guys this morning

Rather than heating an entire room HumanHeater is a microwave technology that can heat the surface of a persons skin instead potentially saving millions in heating costs and helping the environment thereby making the world a better place

Man Judges

Uh OK so you want to heat people with microwaves is that right

That cant be safe

Thats a great question and trust me it is very very safe

Ive been working on it for 15 years

I dont trust you and it cant be safe

And even if it was I dont think you could ever sell the public on this

Thank you

I think when people see the savings on their utility bill and when they see how it saves the environment they will be sold

Microwaves Are you kidding me

Man they are brutal

All right lets light this candle

Where the hell have you been

Uh theres been some developments You know how I fucked Melchers old wife

I fucked his new wife too

What

Uh dont worry hes not gonna find out

I left way before he got back last night and then I didnt go back this morning until 20 minutes after he had left

You went back

How many times did you fuck this woman

The old wife or the new wife

The new wife

Last night or this morning

Erlich what are you thinking This is kind of the big day today

Relax hes not gonna find out Shes not gonna tell him

How the fuck do you know that

Because shed have to be crazy to tell him and I asked her point blank if she was crazy and she swore to me no shes not crazy

Pied Piper youre up

Lets do it

The microwaves only penetrate the top layer of skin cells

I dont believe you It cant be safe

Thank you

Ive been testing it on these guys all winter and theyre fine

Let me just demonstrate it to assure you

No No

No Please

No one is ever going to buy one of these

Ever

That was HumanHeater

Next up Executive Chairman and Chief Visionary Erlich Bachman presenting Pied Piper
