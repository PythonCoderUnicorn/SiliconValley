No interest I entice the flesh I dont pay for it

Plus Taras coming into town in a couple weeks

Im saving up all my humors for her

You know what I mean

Whats your excuse

I didnt even shake a womans hand until I was 17yearsold

The idea of getting an erection around men I live and work with its just not something I can handle

The idea that I have a boner and you have a boner and he has a boner and were all sitting there with boners in our pants

I wonder if hes ok in there

So what do you guys do here

Oh were mostly working on a lossless compression algorithm

A what

It makes files smaller

Doesnt matter Uh its called Pied Piper

Its gonna be famous Youll know it eventually

Who was this woman that you shook hands with for the first time

The postman lady

What

A woman that was a man

Not a postman lady

A lady who was a post

Let me ask you another question

Who was the second woman you shook hands with

Big Head I didnt even know you were coming

Mochacino Stop Yells Doug

Oh boy

Stop

I dont think Im the one

Someone is paying me Ok I didnt come just to dance on your boner all night for free

I was not erect I that was I was only being polite

So you were being polite when you said that you loved me

First off I said you seemed like someone I could fall in love with

And yes also politeness

Richie pay the lady

What Why Why should I pay her

I didnt hire her I didnt even get a lap dance

This is a company party and youre the CEO

So pony up

No

If anyone should pay her it should be you

Doug help the CEO find his money

No No no We dont I dont need help

I know where it is Its here

Mochacino Mmhmm

Do you I dont know Do you accept amex

You damn right I do

Put a hundred on there for yourself Mocha

Well thats an expensive boner

Not a boner

Sighs

Thanks for coming in guys

We have a lot to do so lets get started

Sounds great

Me Ok

Uhh

Well were just really excited to get going Mr Gregory

Yes Whos we

Myself him uh the guys back at the house

Guys

What guys

Who is this

Erlich Bachman Im an entrepreneur much like yourself Uh

Richard actually developed Pied Piper while residing in my Incubator so as per our agreement I own ten percent of the company

Im paying you 200000 for five percent yet youre giving this man twice that in exchange for a futon

And some sandwiches

Actually sir my tenants provide their own food

What other percentages have you apportioned

Sighs Can I see your cap table investment deck business plan or any other relevant paperwork you may have prepared

I I just was under the impression that uh we would just be coming by and saying hi you know uh to pick up the check

And uh I just didnt know that any of that stuff was due yet

Due

Sighs

This is not college Richard

I am not going to be giving you a course syllabus

You turned down ten million dollars to keep Pied Piper

What did you give up that money for What is this company

What did I buy

You bought the algorithm which

No

The algorithm is the product of the company

I know that

What Im asking about is the company itself

Who is it What do they do

Are they essential

Or do you just throw a percentage at them like you did with this

This all must be worked out

Now

When you said youd guide us through some of the stuff I thought that this was the stuff youd be guiding us through

I cannot guide you until you give me something to guide

This is going very poorly

Whispers I know that

He doesnt seem to know what hes doing

Slurps

Did you just take a sip from an empty cup

Yes

Why did you do that

Just something to do

Come back in 48 hours with an airtight business plan a clear gotomarket strategy and three year summary PL or there will be no check

Thats it

Monica Well thanks for coming in guys

Um are there any water fountains in your offices

I assume

I own ten percent of an app that locates all nearby water fountains

Id be happy to discuss it with you

Good day gentlemen

You smoke weed

You really embarrassed me in there

You didnt say shit about any business plan before today

And neither did he And he was kind of being an asshle back there

Yeah thats why hes a billionaire Cause he knows how and when to be an asshle

Thats what you need to be like

You do Richard

Whatever

If you continue to mismanage this company giving ten percent to whoever

Obviously you know we cant go back on my shares

That ship has sailed but from here on out

Now youre being an asshle

You say that like its a bad thing

Richard if youre not an asshle it creates this kind of asshle vacuum and that void is filled by other assholes like Jared

I mean you almost gave him shares

You need to completely change who you are Richard

A complete teutonic shift has to happen

Tectonic

What

A tectonic shift is the earths crust moving around

Teutonic which is what you just said is an ancient Germanic tribe that fought the Romans

They were originally from Scandinavia

Stop it Stop it

Youre being a complete tool right now

I need you to be a complete asshle

Do you understand the difference

If youre not an asshle this company dies

Erlich I have 48 hours

Are you going to help me with this business plan or not

I believe in you Richard Thats why Im not

Business plans that are created in support of new ventures are to implement profound changes in existing venture

Uh

Line ringing

Hi this is Richard Hendricks

Is now a good time

Uh I need some help

Whos Chevy Volt is that out front

Uh Jared Dunns

What Why Why is he here

Well because as you know I need some advice on the business plan

Youre cutting him in

Um

Good morning Whoops that was weird

I dont know why I did that

You kind of have a Like a kingish feeling to you

Youre like a Like a Norse hero from Valhalla

Dont pander to me

Peter Gregory said specifically to trim the fat

They actually tried to diagnose me with a wasting disease because of my slender frame

So um I ironed out our customer acquisition strategy and I wrapped our financials I did a DCF valuation

Most VCs cant even do that math but something tells me Peter is different

I think we can jump into the oneonones with each team member to see if I can defend our cap table

Ok

Um but first if you dont mind Id like to use the restroom

Yeah You dont have to ask permission to do that

Why have you not gone since youve been here

I have not

Well well go I mean go

Denpok I know you were in Aspen thank you for coming Please have a seat

Im not sitting this summer

Of course Incredible

Whats weighing on you Gavin

Jared Dunn quit today to join Pied Piper

I hate Richard Hendricks that little Pied Piper prick

Is is that wrong

In the hands of a lesser person perhaps

But in the hands of the enlightened hate can be a tool for great change

Youre right once again

Exhales deeply

Uh thanks for sitting down like this Gilfoyle

We know its kind of a little weird

So um can you kind of catch me up on what you see as your role in the company

What do you do

What do I do

System architecture Networking and security

No one in this house can touch me on that

Ok thats good to know

But does anyone appreciate that

While you were busy minoring in gender studies and singing a capella at Sarah Lawrence I was gaining root access to NSA servers

I was one click away from starting a second Iranian revolution

I actually went to Vassar

I prevent crosssite scripting I monitor for DDoS attacks emergency database rollbacks and faulty transaction handlings

The Internet heard of it

Transfers half a petabyte of data every minute

Do you have any idea how that happens

All those YouPorn ones and zeroes streaming directly to your shitty little smart phone day after day

Every dipshit who shits his pants if he cant get the new dubstep Skrillex remix in under 12 seconds

Its not magic its talent and sweat People like me ensuring your packets get delivered unsniffed So what do I do

I make sure that one bad config on one key component doesnt bankrupt the entire fucking company

Thats what the fuck I do

Thats basically what I told him

Listen wherever we end up here

I just wanna say that I feel I should get more equity than Dinesh

I know Gilfoyle probably came in here and puked out a bunch of tech specs threefourths of which are total horseshit

Did he bring up the Iranian revolution thing

Yeah those words mean nothing

But heres a fact Im the only one of these clowns that can code in Java

And I write sleek performant lowoverhead scala code with higher order functions that will run on anything

Period End of sentence So basically I think whatever equity I get it should reflect that I contribute more than Gilfoyle

This is weird

Chuckles I know right Its

Everybodys been doing it

Gilfoyle did this

Its just a formality to get me caught up

So what makes you of value to the Pied Piper team

Um programming

I guess pretty good at code develop algorithms So forth

Different from the type of algorithm Richard created

Well yeah Like not as good

Richards a 10xer Im like barely an xer

Both chuckling

I kinda suck

Smoked you And now

Dont be a dick

Mushroom stamp

Youre being a dick

There you go Show that to your mom

Mushroom stamp Thats great

Hey what do you guys think about this Jared Hes shit right

No hes pretty sharp

Yeah he does shit that no one else in the house can do

Yeah but hes a know it all I dont think theres room in here for him

Well there will be after Richard gets rid of Big Head

Wait Richards getting rid of Big Head Why

Listen we all love Big Head

But the truth is hes not as good of a coder as I am not as good at system architecture as Gilfoyle not as good at being a prick as you no offense

Hes a lightweight at everything Brings nothing to the table

Him getting points would be a big fuck you to all of us

But hes a great guy

Great guy But useless

Yeah he is a great guy Not like that Jared

Scoffs At least we can all agree on that

Yeah I dont know

Me and Richard have just always been in this together you know

Together right But to be clear Richard created the algorithm on his own yes

Oh yeah I had nothing to do with that

Hes my best friend

Thats true

Yes The camaraderie is quite apparent

But Peter Gregory demanded a lean ruthless business plan

And I dont think that the CEO of Microsoft has a paid best friend

Sergey Brin does Chuckles Larry doesnt do shit

See

What if Big Head is sort of like a floating utility player Like a jack of all trades

But by his own admission hes really more like a master of none

Thats true That is true

Which is not something youd generally reward with several points in what may some day be a multibillion dollar company

This will never fly with Peter Gregory

I would not want to be Richard right now

Having to tell Big Head that hes out

This is gonna sound super mean but the other night he was sleeping I was just staring at his face

All I could think was Hes utterly useless

Big Head is a man with zero purpose

Jared clears throat

Oh hi Hi Big Head

Hey

Hows it going

Its super good Right now

Um Im just going to maybe go for a bike ride real fast and clear my head

Ill see you

Bike safe

Yeah enjoy it

That was nice guys He heard everything

That doesnt make it not true

I mean come on Richard As far as Pied Piper is concerned hes as pointless as Mass Effect 3s multiple endings

I mean hes a completely useless appendage and we all know it

Oh hey man

Forgot my water bottle

Just gonna grab it and then probably walk right back through one more time

I mean Mass Effect 3 Harsh

I didnt mean for him to hear it but it was true

I mean we all called him a great guy but he didnt overhear any of that

Its been 12 hours

gddmn Hes still not answering

Stammering Im actually kind of worried about him

You know if hes gone like really truly gone in a way that kind of solves your problem

I mean like if hes dead

Are you trying to say that Big Head might be dead

That doesnt help at all How is that helping

Im just saying that thats a possible thing that couldve happened to him

It could happen to anybody And in this case at least something good came out of it

Whats the good part

You dont have to have an awkward conversation

Thats scary Should we go look for him

I mean I agree with these guys Jareds just not working out

What

Um Richard

I uh dont wanna be too assertive here but I could use your input on a few things for the business plan

Richie you tried your best just call him leave a message say hes out

No thats an asshle move

Yeah remember You need to be an asshle

I feel bad about saying that thing about him being dead

Thats not who I am

Alarm blaring

Wait what is that

Thats impossible

NipAlert isnt live yet

Maybe hes demoing it for someone

Mochacino

He rode his bike to San Jose

Jared can I borrow your car

Sure

I have a car

What Whats wrong with my car

I just have I dont know

All right well remember to be an asshle

A real asshle

Hi Im Richard Hendricks You did a dance The dancing at my house

Your rides here

Oh hey man

I just wanted to work with computers and get paid for it

I didnt want end up fighting with my roommates over percentage points

So youre just gonna give up

As much as Ive tried its just not

I mean what wouldve I have even done if I didnt have Mochacinos card

Where would I have gone Its fucking pathetic

Well Mochacino seemed to like you She let you into her apartment

I had to give her my bike Shes just like everyone else in this gddmn Valley

Watching the bottom line fuck it dude Im done here

What about NipAlert

Mochacino shows her tits for a living and even she was uncomfortable using it

She said it was sexist Shes right Its actually perverted

I made a perverted sexist useless thing

And you know everybodys right man theres nothing for me to do on Pied Piper

I think over time maybe we could redefine your role

Come on dude Unless you can tell me right now what I can do for Pied Piper that no one else can Im gone

Yeah

Im going to go get the stuff out of my cube at Hooli and then Im getting the hell out of this town

So this is goodbye then

You know if I wanted to be a sell out Id have done that already

Id be on a beach somewhere with ten million dollars in my pocket

Not in my pocket in a bank account

Ok This is my company It was my idea and we do what I say

And what I say is Jared put Big Head in the business plan

He gets the same amount of shares as everybody else

Big Head youre not going home man

Youre right Im not

Gavin Belson just offered me a huge promotion for 600 grand a year to steal me away from you guys

What

Yeah For revenge Because you took Jared

So youre like the VP of spite

But you have to do me a favor Richard if you run into Gavin ever you have to act really upset about it you know

Oh but I am upset

Ok What the fuck I kind of just went out on a limb for you here man

Sorry man but this is huge for me

Im going to move out get my own place

In light of this new information who gets Big Heads equity

Should I get half of his shares

I do I get it

Ok I get all of it

Big Head man congratulations on the job really

Richard Wait wait are you sure about this

Big Head Yeah dude Gavin wants to beat you to market
