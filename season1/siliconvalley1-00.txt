Man For thousands of years guys like us have gotten the shit kicked out of us

But now for the first time we are living in an era where we can be the vikings of our day

Are you going to help me with this or not

You turned down 10 million to be able to develop something you cant even describe to another human being

I say this only to motivate you

Oh man look at this place

Save your childishness

Theres 40 billion of net worth walking around this party

Cut

I was interested in doing a show about Silicon Valley because I lived there and worked there as an engineer

The worlds very interesting to me

I just knew a lot of these types

They always travel in groups of five these programmers

Theres always a tall skinny white guy

Short skinny Asian guy

Fat guy with a ponytail

Some guy with crazy facial hair

And then an East Indian guy

Its like they trade guys until they all have the right group

You clearly have a great understanding of humanity

Judge Same kind of personalities now

I think theres more money which makes it more interesting

We start out in the series as Richard  Co or just conerds trying to figure it all out

Theres money flying all over Silicon Valley but none of it ever seems to hit us

Richard is a humble employee at Hooli and he doesnt like it

He wants more

Richard has been developing a music app but buried in the heart of that music app is this kind of kernel of genius

Do you even realize the impact that a compression this good could have on the world

This is game changing

Im prepared to give you 200000

Six hundred thousand for ten percent of your company

Ten million

I will take a small piece but the company will belong to you not Gavin Belson

Um you know

Pull your head out of your ass Richard

Richard is lured by the notion of being in complete control of his own destiny and ends up going with the rock and roll Peter Gregory

My first official purchase as CEO of Pied Piper

Thats not really our logo is it

It looks like a guy sucking a dck and hes got another dck tucked behind his ear for later

Its like a snack dck

The show is basically a howto in starting your own business and doing it the wrong way

Doing it the wrong way Were terrible at it

Erlich is a guy who he had this company Aviato

Sold Aviato for a few million and was able to buy this house

And now Ive become kind of the smallest most pathetic version of a venture capitalist

He owns and administers the house that these guys all live in

The Hacker Hostel

Miller I let people stay at the house for free and then I own 10 of the company

Gavin Belson likes Pied Piper

I own 10 of Pied Piper

You said it was a shitty idea

It was a shitty idea

Im not sure what it is now

Hes a talker and hes charming so he can smoothly talk his way into pretty much any situation including onstage during a Flo Rida concert

Look at Erlich

See thats what I wish I had

Its like I dont have any um

Game

Game Yes Thats it

Gilfoyle in a way is kind of a quintessential programmer type

Hes a satanist

Which is basically just he likes to party and have fun

Sin is a thing of beauty

Whats with the cross

Its an upside down cross

Not from here it isnt

We have a rivalry so were arguing about who the better programmer is

I just want to say that I feel I should get more equity than Dinesh

Whatever equity I get it should reflect that I contribute more than Gilfoyle

Big Head is Richards best friend

Man Hes sort of a happy go lucky kind of hapless person who freely admits that hes not as good at coding as Richard

What if Big Head is sort of like uh a floating utility player

Kind of like a Jack of all trades

But by his own admission hes really more like a master of none

Thats true That is true

When Richard is sort of taking ownership of this company he needs to let Big Head know that Big Head is really nonessential personnel

So this is goodbye then

Its one of the first kind of difficult choices that Richard has to make as the CEO of this new company

Gavin Belson just offered me a job for 600 grand a year

What

Yeah for revenge

So youre like the VP of spite

I play Gavin Belson who is the CEO and founder of Hooli

He wants to buy and crush Richard Hendricks

I hate Richard Hendricks that little Pied Piper prick

Is that wrong

Gavin is sort of in the mold of one of these guys who has accomplished so much they think they can do anything

Hes the least cool guy Ive ever met

Jareds a guy whos second in command to Gavin Belson and he defects from Hooli to join this pirate ship of young tech guys




    push

Hey Sorry if I scared you

I know I have some like ghostlike features

My uncle used to say you look like someone starved a virgin to death

Jared just happily takes the shape of whatever shoe is pressing down on him

His strength would be his meticulousness and his material feelings

From rules based filtering we go to workflow

At which point that card is moved from the icebox into the in progress column and it stays there until it is ready for testing

And that gentlemen is scrum

This just became a job

Gavin Belson is spurned by Richard in favour of Peter Gregory who promises Richard he will help Richard find his way

Man Hes this weirdo eccentric billionaire who cant talk to people and yet has that vision that can see just beyond the horizon

Gagging

Hi Monica

I work with Peter Gregory

My character is kind of the right hand woman for Peter Gregory

Shes independent shes strong and she holds her own in this world that is dominated by men

Shes part of the 2 women that there are in the tech world

Crew I was a little nervous working with all of these amazing comedians

Theyve been nothing but so welcoming and sweet to me and I feel like Im one of the guys

Grow a pair and talk to her Find out for sure

Why dont you grow a pair and Ill talk to her

Judge The cast in this is really great

Man These guys are all young really talented improv comedy guys

Theyre really good at playing off each other

We just kind of wrote to that

One of the cools things about the show is that we all knew each other in some capacity

In real life were very similar

Miller I mean theyre actually legitimate nerds

I dont know Are you similar

No

Laughs

Miller In real life Im kind of the least nerdy guy

I think Im the only person thats been in a fight

Many times Mr Michael Judge will see what were doing which is like playing video games or playing some other obscenely nerdy thing and hell just go huh Man art imitates life

Hes super annoying because not only is he like obviously a comic genius hes also like a sick upright bassist

The one thing I did remark when I first met him is hes handsome

Hes got a strong jaw line

He has really beautiful eyes

Oh yeah Handsome fella

Hes going to see this Its going to be weird

Miller He sounds exactly like butthead from Beavis and Butthead

I dont know if he knows the guy or he used to watch that growing up a lot or what

Well Mike Judge does have actual street cred as an engineering nerd

I never really knew the distinction between nerds and geeks and its changed over the years

People nerd out on what is defined as nerd versus geek

Geeks to me are so they kind of geek out on certain stuff

Geek is like a guy who like has adult braces and gets in your not theres anything wrong with adult braces but like I feel like he has like elective adult braces

Geeks obviously have some sort of traumatic past

Big Heads a nerd Gilfoyles the geek

Dinesh is a nerd

Uh and Erlich is a drug addict

Erlich Im making the world a better place

Making the world a better place

Making the world a better place

Making the world a better place

Making the world a better place

Sir Are you okay in there

There are these kind of characters who if they were born 300 years ago would not be the richest people in the world

And now you have these guys with billions of dollars and theyre still the same kind of socially awkward types

They just dont quite know how to have fun with it

That is a narrow car

fcking billionaires

Its the Hollywood of tech



Whooo

Man What a dck

Its weird

Its like its not enough that theyre making billions of dollars they also have to be always talking about how theyre making the world a better place

You know were making a lot of money

And yes were disrupting digital media

But most importantly were making the world a better place through constructing elegant class hierarchies for maximum code reuse and extensibility

Yeah

You do not have to know anything about tech to get the humour of the show

When our guys are talking about tech we try and always attach it to some sort of an emotion where even if you dont understand what theyre saying you understand the thought behind it

OKeeffe Mike and Alec Berg really pulled out all the stops with multiple researchers and consultants to make sure that this all reflects the reality of the world were trying to portray

Because you know we really really want to get it right

I think we have

At some point I want to make sure its all accurate and real and then after that it probably just goes in one ear and out the other for me

What weve recreated in the other room is an exact replica of a real conference TechCrunch Disrupt

Its a bunch of venders or a bunch of startup companies that all come together and they pitch their wares in the hopes of winning TechCrunch

Crew They have to present their app and fingers crossed it works

And if it does its game changing for all of them

And if it doesnt theyre screwed

We learned about all these companies

We learned about what TechCrunch was and in very many ways we really learned a lot about the depth of the tech industry

Weve recruited a lot of the companies that were actually present at the real TechCrunch

So a lot of the companies that have booths here theyre kind of peddling their wares are real companies

So many companies So many names

Any combination of letters are already taken

What about smaller

Because then thats an even smaller version of the word smaller

So that it looks like smiler

Were not going to kick the shit out of nucleus with smiler

Kwerpy

Yeah theres a kwerpy You gotta spell it with a k

You cant clear anything

The name defines the company

It has to be something primal

Something that you can scream out during intercourse

Pied Piper

Ugh

Ross I think Silicon Valley the show is very much about making your way in the world and the choices you make presented in a comedic fashion but under the very intense fire of everything thats happening in Silicon Valley right now

Its just cool to see you know what that breathes in people when like literally from one day to the next you could become a multi multi millionaire

OKeeffe But its in a world that I dont think people have seen a lot of on television so its interesting

What Mike and Alec have really brought to this is a relatability of guys and friendship and sort of normal people but set in this world with these heightened stakes and that part of it is universal
