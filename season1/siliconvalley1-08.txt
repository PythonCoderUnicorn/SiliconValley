indistinct yelling

Ill rip your dick off you son of a bitch

My eye

On behalf of the entire Disrupt conference I would like to apologize for what happened out there this afternoon

This man will never be asked to judge again

Ive just learned hes been fired from Oracle and apparently his wife left him

Anyway I just got a call from your attorney Mr LaFlamme informing me that in his view this incident is actionable

And in addition to holding TechCrunch liable for any damages which may include the loss to Pied Piper of potentially billions in revenue and share value uh he be may naming me personally in a lawsuit

So I would like to propose that we put this incident behind us legally speaking by sending Pied Piper directly through to the finals of StartUp Battlefield where you will compete for the grand prize

How does that sound

I think thats

One question uh regarding our hotel accommodations

Bam Am I right guys

chuckles I was just happy you got punched in the face Erlich but now Im super happy I feel like I won twice

Im gonna disrupt this bathroom

I dont think this couch pulls out I guess Ill get myself a rollaway bed

I mean youre welcome guys I had to fuck a wife and take a punch but now we get to go into the finals tomorrow without having blown our wad in the prelims

Were trending up boys We are trending up

Maybe youre right But we should probably get back down there and check out the competition

man on PA Ladies and gentlemen Gavin Belson

applause

No matter what you may have heard size matters

Welcome everyone to a journey into the Nucleus

I hope this sucks

Nucleus will provide the most diverse features ever assembled in a cloudbased compression suite

Massive functionality interconnectivity and the simplicity one has come to expect from the Hooli family

Were making all your files available for lightningfast download

Accessible from any device

All these features will be seamlessly synced to Hoolimail Hoolisearch and the full suite of Hooli computing power

Thats a lot of functionality

Dont worry he cant come close to our Weissman score

Even with all this extra shit its like a fancy car with a crappy engine

Gavin And now for the moment of truth

As you will now see our Weissman score is the best in the history of compression

crowd gasping

What the fuck

Thats exactly the same score as us

Twopointeightnine That is not an error

We are breathing rare air here operating at the limit for lossless compression in audio video and data

Anyone who tells you that their platform is faster than ours better have good lawyers

I hope youve enjoyed your journey into the Nucleus

We have the speed We have the features And we have Shakira

 Shakira Hips Dont Lie

crowd applause and cheering

Shakira Hola TechCrunch

I mean they just completely reverse engineered our entire compression engine

He totally sniped us

Well be fine

What

They judge this contest on viability in the marketplace

I mean at best were a worse version of Nucleus

I mean they have 50 modules and theyre all awesome

We have five that barely work

I mean were still have trouble compressing 3D files Whos lining up to buy that

Who the fuck cares

So the platform cant handle 3D files You know what 3D movies suck anyway

I could actually argue this Gavin nonsense is a positive

Please dont

We just need to really dial it up for the big show tomorrow

Dial what up He just ruined us

And until then we need to do what any animal in nature does when its cornered act erratically and blindly lash out at everything around us

Im gonna go get in Gavins head

Hey guys I just had a thought OK so this is it right

A lot of successful startups launched with a different business model and when they ran into trouble they pivoted to something new

Like Instagram That was a locationbased checkin service when it started

And then they pivoted

Or Chat Roulette OK that was social media and then they pivoted to become a playground for the sexually monstrous

We just need a new idea something that people want Right We can pivot too

Dude you are fucked up right now

Yeah youre pinning bad

Well Ill admit Im sleepchallenged

I just spent four days trapped in a steel box out on an oil rig full of robotforklifts

So that was hard but Im back

I am recovering and I am focused and were gonna pivot Dont lose faith guys

All right look at me Look at me Look at me

Weve got a great name Weve got a great team

Weve got a great logo and weve got a great name

Now we just need an idea

Lets pivot Lets pivot

That might be the last time we see him alive

I think Im just gonna take a walk and you know try and clear my head

Ill see you guys back at the hotel room and well figure out what to do

Were going to be poor

Hi Id like to talk to you about a company called Pied Piper

What does it do Good question

Maybe you can help us find an answer

What if Pied Piper was an app that could attract rodents

You know like the fairy tale

For purposes of extermination or to feed your pet snake

Were not here to tell you what to do with your rats were here to get your rats STAT

Would you be very interested somewhat interested or not interested

Which one Which one Which one

Look at them all full of hope Pricks

Oh look Kwerpys here recruiting

They just got 20 million in Series A at a 280 million dollar valuation

Wow

That could have been us

Its too bad we already have jobs we could easily go work there

Yeah Itd be a real dickhead move to bail on Richard now right

I mean before we officially go under

Yeah Yeah Total dickhead move

Yeah Yeah

Even though it is just a matter of days

And we are so close

I mean he is standing right there

But Im not a dickhead

No Neither am I

Yep just a couple of nondickheads

My dick and my head totally separate

Youve heard the phrase Time to pay the piper right

What if there was an app called Pied Piper that could tell you to a statistical degree of certainty whether you were going to heaven or hell

Very interested somewhat interested not interested

Which one Which one Which one

So you made some really overthetop promises about Nucleus

Can you deliver

Absolutely

For me Kara goodness greatness these are not simply catch phrases but in fact really the intention of Hooli from the beginning

Gavin you do not need to dignify any of this with a response

I can speak for myself Erlich Bachman Pied Piper

Was I brutally assaulted Yes

Did Gavin Belson here have anything to do with it Unclear

All I know is that the rumor that TechCrunch is all abuzz about is unproven

Wait what rumor

Thank you

Why would Gavin have anything to do with this

Unless he had some reason to be frightened by Pied Piper and its superior technology

This and all other Gavin Belson rumors are unsubstantiated

OK the alcoholism the sexual impropriety at work the impending crash of Hoolis stock

This is the most ridiculous

Exactly So why repeat the lascivious details with which all of us are undoubtedly already familiar

Guilty or not Gavin I stand with you

Care to comment

Lets keep moving shall we

Yes lets all keep moving Lets move on from this

I forgive you Gavin No matter how brutally I was assaulted

Wow Pied Piper sounds like a great place to work

Oh yeah it is

Pied Piper is the best right

Oh my God everyday feels like Ive died and gone to hell

Im sorry

Hes a Satanist so its good

Mmhmm

Oh fun

The point is we love our company and I dont have a problem saying that out loud

You

Love it

We both say it out loud and I think that fact proves that were not dickheads

So what we wanted to ask you was

Guys

Totally between us our beta crapped out

The VCs did a full clawback and our Series A is DOA

Were going down We have enough runway for maybe two three weeks max

So do you guys think you could hire me

How much would it be worth to you if I told you I had a GPS app called Pied Piper tracking the location of your child

I can follow your child anywhere and there is nothing you can do to stop me

Most missing children are never found

Interested very interested or very interested

Richard Hi

Hey suitcase Yeah

Yeah

So youre

Peter called He saw Erlichs presentation such as it was

And Gavins

So he wants me to go back to Palo Alto

Theres just a few other things he wants me working on

Now that were you know dead in the water

Listen Im sorry you walked away from the money like you did

But I swear I only wanted Peter to seed you because I thought you had a really great company

It just didnt work out for you this time

Uh can I be honest with you

I havent had more than two straight hours of sleep in months

Ive had a cold for like a year

My stomach cramps up so much I feel like Im menstruating

Maybe this is for the better

Look I gotta go

Im really sorry that were not gonna be working together anymore

Yeah me too

I guess I guess we wont see each other again

Well I mean now that the rules about socializing with coworkers arent in effect anymore Let me know if you want to grab a drink sometime

What like a drink drink

You go on dates with failures awkward chuckle

Constantly

OK

Uh bye OK

Bye chuckles

You have any weapons or drugs on your person at this time

Why yes Yes I do

Adderall This is a highly controlled substance Are these yours

No Those belong to an underage kid that I brought to my house

Yeah sir Im going to have to ask you to come with me

Thats a kind invitation but I have too much to do Im pivoting

Lets go now

No Im pivoting Im pivoting

Im pivoting

I mean what do we even present tomorrow

Honestly anyone

Why do we have to present at all

Whats that supposed to mean

If we are going to fail and be humiliated why do it on stage in front of 1000 people and a livestreamed audience

Are you saying we shouldnt even show up

No offense but its basically going to be a public execution

Yes and public executions are very popular

Its show business We are not quitting Richard

Look Erlich I want to present I do its just I dont know

door lock clicking

Jesus are you OK

What Yeah I OK

Yeah all good They let me go

Gilfoyle Who let you go

When was the last time you slept Jared

Absolutely David What are we talking about gents

Were talking about how I didnt get to present in the prelims because I was too busy getting my face pummeled so that our team could move forward

Thats why were presenting tomorrow

And you know what Were going to win

Yeah were gonna win even if I have to go into the auditorium and personally jerk off every guy in the audience

Thats a lot of jerking

And we only have ten minutes to present So

So were fucked arent we

Yeah even if hes jerking two at a time there are what 800 guys in that room

So thats 400 times whatever the mean jerktime is

The what

Mean jerktime

I mean it doesnt matter but hypothetically time is equal to 400 total jerks at a twodick rate

Unless Erlich jerks off four guys at a time and then we can cut that in half

How would he do four guys Hes got two hands so thats two dicks at a time right

Look you have two guys on either side with their dicks tip to tip so youre going fulllength Four see

Oh

From the middle out That does make sense

Like two Shake Weights

Yeah so what were trying to do hypothetically is minimize time which is 800 dudes multiplied by meanjerk time divided by four dicks at a time

Of course Erlich would have to presort guys by height so that their dicks lined up

Not by height technically

The measurement that were looking for really is dick to floor

Call that D2F

Huh

Oh my God

You know if a guys dick was long enough it would be able to reach up or down to another guy with a different D2F

The longer the dick the greater the D2F bridge but I would still be able to jerk it off in one smooth motion

Id just have to jerk it on an angle




    push

Gilfoyle So D2F sub1 needs to equal D2F sub2 and D2F sub3 needs to equal D2F sub4 where length L creates a complimentary shaft angle

Im such an idiot Middle out

Middle out Middle out Oh my God

How could I Uh

Guys does girthsimilarity affect Erlichs ability to jerk different dicks simultaneously

Shit Yeah I think it would

rapid tapping on keyboard

Of course it does Time to orgasm or T2O has to be the same for each matching pair of dicks otherwise Im wasting a lot of great strokes on a guy thats already busted

Unless you can hotswap dicks in and out So on a downstroke you get a new one in

So when you stroke up youre not wasting any energy

Even so I think this is the most reliable metric for stamina

Guys Richards been locked in here for almost two hours Do we think hes OK

Erlich Hmm You dont think hed

He did seem pretty bummed out

house music blares

music continues

muffled chatter

door opens

sighs

All right guys lets go

The finals are starting clears throat Up

Gilfoyle

Richard Jesus

What happened to the door

Dont worry about it Richard is the platform up and running

I made a few changes but yeah

OK tell me on the walk All right you dildos lets go

All right talk to me Richard What were you working on last night

Well uh I mightve made a breakthrough

Erlich Really so everything is working

Richard Uh technically no

snoring

Lets face it ladies is there anything less sexy than when a users visualization UX is completely suboptimal

I mean its the worst right

So weve gone through all the research and all the steps

We have a solution for these problems and Zenella is ready to bring it to the marketplace

Yeah I get it Richard You changed a lot

Just give me the basics and I can roll with it

I need to know what Im presenting here

I dont think I have time to explain it all

What the hell does that mean

Richard Is this the right build I cant find the mobile suite here

Uh it is nowhere I deleted it

Dinesh What

Here they are

Pied Pipers here

Sorry were late

Richard talk to me

I cant front a band without knowing what were playing

Uh Im think Im just going to do the presentation myself

Wait what No no no Richard Richard Richard Richard

Respectfully Respectfully youre terrible

You have world class showman standing right in front of you and youre going to pass on that

Release me Richard Release the Kraken

Pied Piper Youre on

This is it

Dinesh I dont know what you did Richard but I hope it works

Richard Me too

All right lets welcome our final team to the finals of this years TechCrunch Disrupt StartUp Battlefield

Presenting for Pied Piper is Erlich Bachman

applause

Uh actually there has been a change of plans

Presenting for Pied Piper will be Richard Hendricks

applause

Erlich Richard

Sorry Got a little lightheaded there for a second

I set em up for you now knock em down

Gilfoyle I dont understand I thought he made the platform better

He just deleted everything

Dinesh Maybe he moved it to the cloud

No All The Carvers work is gone

Pied Piper is a cloud based compression Without the cloud nothings left

Gentlemen this is likely the last ten minutes of Pied Piper so lets enjoy it

Dinesh Has he lost his mind

Gilfoyle Hes lost his fucking mind

Hello Hello Hello

Um I am My name is Richard Hendricks and I am along with this guy him him and another guy that has disappeared

Uh um We are Pied Piper A compression company

Well you know in your pamphlets it says that we are a cloud based multiplatform solution for userfocused compression

And we were Until yesterday

But now we are not

Uh because you see Hooli did everything that we were tying to do better way better

Um

Nucleus is built on the same engine as ours like exactly the same and their Weissman score was 289 same as ours

But the thing is they built a ton of really great stuff up on top of that

And we cant compete so now we have to be something else

Um wellplayed Hooli chuckles

Uh OK so anyway we all know that the most obvious way to compress files is with Shannon coding right Top down

Richard they cant see that its too small

OK

Literally hundreds of people here

Oh no but I need

Shit OK

Um right oh

Uh so Shannon coding and then David Huffman came along and he pioneered bottom up and LempelZiv with left to right obviously

And for decades we used these codes to compress you know JPEGs MPEGs MP3s zips all that stuff

But we all know that so theres no point in talking about it

But what happened was last night I was watching my friends here have this argument

About you know manipulating data

And you know how many datas could one guy manipulate at once and uh

chuckles

And I was just I was thinking

Maybe it could be another way you know

Something that I would call middle out

Its up and down back and forth all at the same time going on at once

OK well anyway I deleted all our modules last night and I completely rebuilt our engine from scratch last night

Um

Now this morning I really only had enough time to do one test and when I did we hit a Weissman score of 38

Now I know the theoretical limit was 29 but as you can see here

Im sorry You scored a 38

Uh Yes sir

And this is a universal lossless compression engine

Text Audio Video

Yes that is correct

Well Im sorry to interrupt your eloquent presentation Richard

But rather than say anything more why dont we just give you a file and well see whether this thing can do what you say it does

Because if it cant then were done here right

Yeah Yeah thats fair

So we can give you any kind of file and you can compress it without degradation at this standard Threeeight

Yes yep

All right give us a minute please

What do we got

man Does anyone have anything

Do you have something

Ive got a file for him

OK Andy Stafford here has a file for you

OK

Its a 132 gigabytes uncompressed and its a 3D video file

OK

Shit

Erlich A fucking 3D file

Yes

Are you fucking kidding me

Goddammit

Erlich Can we handle this

Richard I guess well find out

Erlich Dammit I hope this works

Shit its hung

Oh no

Is it stuck

There is a time limit you have two minutes remaining

Come on come on come on

computer beeps

It looks like its done

Gilfoyle Wait 24 gigs What happened

Oh shit theres no way

It didnt compress the whole thing It should be twice that size

I mean 24 gigs thats less than a fourth the file size

That seems dubious Richard

Why dont we run a Weissman test for verification see where we went wrong

OK I mean it shouldnt take too long it only compressed half the fucking file

Im sorry I shouldnt have rewritten all this code

I mean what we had before worked

Im sorry guys Gavin won We lost

At least it didnt happen in a public and brutally embarrassing way

Thanks Gilfoyle

Yeah

Wait a second Whats happening

Theres no errors look

computer beeps

crowd murmuring

Fivepointtwo How how

Wait what

Gilfoyle Wait it compressed the whole file

Thats the whole file

Its just half the size I thought it would be

Ladies and gentlemen obviously were going to keep looking at this to verify but with a confirmed score of 52 Pied Piper appears to have just doubled the best Weissman score ever measured Doubled it

Pied Piper ladies and gentlemen

Lets hear it for them

Holy shit

Hey Im at TechCrunch

This kid Hendricks and Pied Piper just ran a two minute mile

We should get on this now

Suck it Gavin Belson

Hendricks you beautiful bstrd

I told you wed do it Come on laughing

Were not going to be poor

What happened What happened What happened

Uh we just won the cup

screams

And I dont think it comes as any shock that the winner of this years Disrupt Cup and 50000 like theyre going to need it is Pied Piper

So Richard wrote the code

Richard wrote the code yes but the inspiration was clear

Let me ask you something

How fast do you think you could jack off every guy in this room

Cause I know how long it would take me

And I can prove it

Nice

Thank you so much

I dont fully understand it but I would definitely like to invest

Oh great

Really impressed

I really want to get you in front of my partners

Really soon

Oh wow I appreciate that guys

Well hopefully well talk to each other soon

Thanks

Thanks

Hey

Monica

Congratulations You were amazing up there

Thank you

I just spoke with Peter

He watched the livestream via satellite and said he was not unpleased

Oh yeah thats great

So I guess were back to working together huh

Yeah Yeah I guess so

Its gonna get pretty insane for you Richard

Yeah

Youre going to have more offers of funding than youre going to know what to do with

Yeah

Youre going to have to grow a business hire a staff rent offices get an assistant

Peter is going to be a lot more hands on and a lot tougher on you

People may take credit for your idea and try and sue you

How awesome is that

Uh yeah thats awesome

I mean if you thought it was crazy getting to this point youre not going to believe what it turns into from here

Right

I mean pretty soon you could be managing thousands of employees who are all looking up to you

Gavin Belson hes not going away anytime soon

Mmm

But its going to be amazing

Excuse me a second

Oh Jesus
