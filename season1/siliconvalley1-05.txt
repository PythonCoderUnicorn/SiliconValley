Its a fucking sketchy neighborhood man

You said he had paintings in galleries

His works hang in the gallery of the streets

Ill be back in a flash

Whoa no What

Whoa Um

Chuy Ramirez Erlich Bachman

We spoke on the phone

Whats up man

Pleasure to meet you

All right

This is great Look at this

This is what we need you know what I mean Something raw

We already have kind of a shitty name Pied Piper but the last thing we want is two lowercase Ps in a square like those mtherfuckers across the freeway would make

This is what we want

So you gonna give me stock options or what

What

Yeah You know Dave Cho

He did the murals over at Facebook

He got a stock option deal ended up making like a hundred million dollars

I want a deal like that

You know I dont really speak all that Wall Street bullshit

You know what Im saying

Were just like five guys hanging out in a house trying to make cool shit

Well you told me you own ten percent of it so you must know something about it right

You could just give me some of your points

Hey Im not an accountant you know

I dont even know what that means a lot of those words

You fucking prick

grunting

grunts

doors lock

Oh you fucker

Let me in Please please

Ill break this I dont care I dont care

Ill break this

I cant hear you

car horn blaring

Oh God

I cant hear you

honks horn intermittently

Yeah but you dont want stock in our company

If I could go back in time I wouldnt have taken the stock

I wouldve taken cash only Im telling you

horn continues

Whos that dude

Uh nobody Hes a coder

You got a Latino working for you

Thats cool yo Not a lot of Latinos working in tech

Yeah Yeah hes Latino

Yeah and hes one of the best coders we have

Kind of adds a Latin flair to the company

I told you we do things differently

Yeah You know what

I could do a cash deal for a Latino company

I think we should get out of here though because I just painted over some dudes shit and people get shot behind that

So Ill catch you on the flip Peace

Uh OK Peace Chuy

Oh God This is

This is very real

Hey Dinesh Get in the fucking car

There may be a driveby about to happen

Dinesh What

Latino hiphop music plays

You promised this guy ten thousand dollars without any approval

Are you high

A little bit yeah

But thats irrelevant

A cool company needs a cool logo

You think those guys over at Nucleus are hiring a convicted felon to paint a mural on their garage

For ten thousand dollars No

Look I took a run at a burndown chart

Jesus fucking Christ

Its not pretty

The way things are going were not gonna finish for five months and even with everyone on reduced salaries well exhaust all our funding in four

And thats without wasting ten thousand dollars on artwork

Wasting I got a great deal

You know he wanted stock options until he saw Dinesh

Hold on what

Dont be offended but for some weird reason Chuy took a look at you and thought you were a Mexican

laughs

Why would I be offended by that

What

Why would I be offended by him thinking Im Mexican

Hes Mexican right

Yeah he is but youre not Youre Pakistani

So Actually the very fact that you think this would be offensive to me is offensive

Youre the one being racist

No Im not the one who called you a Mexican

Called me a Mexican Youre doing it again

Im bending over backwards to not be racist right now

All right Well what did he say when you told him I wasnt Mexican

I didnt

And why not

Because I wanted him to paint our garage for cheap

I I genuinely dont know how to respond to that

You know Im not gonna take the bait here

I am not a racist all right

I watch a lot of black prn I mean a lot

One question

In this prn is the man black or the woman black or are they both

Is one of those racist and the others arent

Ill hack his browser history Well get to the bottom of this

Dinesh Yep

Hold on Thats unnecessary

Hold on

Richard

Can you explain this to me

muffled music plays

Hmm What

I just got a text from my friend at TechCrunch

Pied Piper just got into this years StartUp Battlefield

Oh really Oh thats so cool

No No it isnt Were already seeded Richard

Why would we enter a startup competition at a tech conference

I sent in the application a few months ago and I totally forgot about it

Relax I will withdraw

Relax This house is chaos

I gave up a great job and stock options at Hooli to come here because I thought Pied Piper could be viable but it never will be unless we make some changes

We need to operate like a business or were not going to

muffled music plays over headphones

Richard Richard

Thanks for coming in Nelson

Mr Belson is very excited to meet with you

I thought he was in Jackson Hole this week

Yes he is Were going to call him up on the TeleHuman

Its amazing Its holographic 3D teleconferencing technology that weve acquired

Its going to feel as if Gavin is right here in the room with you

computer chimes

Oh its him

Its him

Hello Nelson Thanks for meeting with me

Whoa Hi Thats cool

Am I a hologram over there too

What No of course not

Question do you still talk to Richard Hendricks

Uh yeah I mean not about Nucleus or anything

Why would he enter Pied Piper in TechCrunch Disrupt

I know a lot of big players have come out of it Dropbox Yammer what have you

But Peter Gregorys already funding him

Why would he let Richard do this It makes no sense

I dont know I didnt even know Richard got in

Is Peter Gregory toying with me

Is he trying to make Richard seem folksy

Like some awshucks boygenius entering an everymans competition voice skips

Mr Bel Mr Belson

Can you hear me

Hello

Can you hear me

Yeah its just

Its sort of fading

voice skipping Hellllo

Hello

Helloooo skipping continues

Im hearing you its just the image is

Nelson shut up for a second

If you can hear me make a gesture

Is that do you I hear you

Is this

I have no idea what youre saying Nelson

voice skippingNelson Nelson

Can you help me please

beeping

OK I think what happened was when you set it up you forgot to

I didnt set it up

I paid one of you people to set it up Just fix it

Man Uh OK

Heres the thing its not working

Um the audios still working You could just use that

Gavin The audio is working Excuse me

I paid twenty million fucking dollars to acquire this company

fuck you the audio is working

Audio worked a hundred fucking years ago

You fucking piece of shitttt voice skipping

computer beeps

It appears weve lost him

Yeah

Why dont we just HooliChat instead

Yeah

clears throat

Ah Thats better

Sorry The TeleHuman is a great piece of technology

Unfortunately the broadband isnt that great out here in rural Wyoming

That presents a great business opportu

audio freezes

computer beeps

audio breaking up Nelson make a gesturehear me

Oh for fucks sake

computer beeps

Uh I think you forgot to update your software

God dammit Fu

computer beeps

Nelson Oh

cell phone rings

Hello Oh hi Gavin

Whats that Im sorry youre kind of breaking up there

He Hello Hello

Jared OK lets start the meeting

I think we need to define our corporate culture

Our whole corporate culture is that we dont have a corporate culture

That is totally ridiculous Gilfoyle

The main reason dogs are perceived to have a more keen sense of smell is because their noses are closer to the ground

Therefore with a little practice I could easily have as keen a sense of smell as a dogs

Guys I guess you didnt see the sign

Were actually having a meeting here

Congratulations

Its sort of for management only

Are you fucking serious right now

Are you really kicking us out

Well I thought maybe you guys could just take your food into the living room

So you want to have a meeting in the room where all the food is while we eat our food in the room where all of the computers are

Guys just five minutes Please

OK you see This This is a case in point

This is a company and yet we have no boundaries and no protocol

We need to establish a clear corporate culture or were not gonna make it

Take Dinesh and Gilfoyle

They are wasting an enormous amount of time arguing

What if we were to separate them right

Divide their existing work space into two areas

We could put in some kind of portable barrier

Hes talking about cubicles

Gilfoyle We are not doing cubicles No way

No no no Dont think of it as a cubicle

Just think of it as a neutralcolored enclosure about yayhigh around your workspace

OK fine But do you know who uses cubicles

Every single Fortune 500 company

Why Because they work

Hes trying to turn us into corporate rock Richard

Jared No

We are punk rock

Actually you know I think a better analogy would be jazz

Like we riff and improvise around a central theme to create one cohesive piece of music

No no They teach fucking jazz at Juilliard

Were not jazz Were fucking punk rock

You see You see you guys are arguing over what metaphor to use to agree with each other

This is the inefficiency Im trying to eliminate

My suggestions could actually help you beat me in this argument

Do you see the irony there

blowing raspberry

I I cant argue with this




    push

car horn honking

Chuy Yo Erlich

Uh Chuys here

No And this this This is the craziest one of all

I mean were really about to spend ten thousand dollars ononon a logo we could generate inhouse for free

Its madness You want a logo

Here just

There I just saved this company ten thousand dollars

Are you fucking serious Lowercase letters

Twitter lowercase t

Google lowercase g

Facebook lowercase f

Every fucking company in the Valley has lowercase letters

Why Because its safe

But we arent going to do that

Were gonna go with Chuy

Unless any of you gringos wants to go out there and tell a guy with three assault convictions that were not gonna give him the money we promised him

Hm Thats what I thought

I mean God

Are you still enjoying your asparagus sir

I was never enjoying it

I only eat it for the nutrients

You may take it

Oh shit

Peter I dont want to upset you whispers but Gavin Belson just walked in

raspy choking sound

Does he see us

I dont know He must know that youre here

If I scurry to the restroom do you imagine he would

Peter

I didnt know you came here

Gavin Hello

Nice to see you

And you as well

How are you

Well

And you

Not bad

I just got back from Jackson Hole

Have you been

I have not

But I hear good things

You look well Are you exercising

I have begun to do Pilates

Well I hear thats good

I like it

Yes

Well I didnt mean to interrupt

Nice to see you Peter

Goodbye now

OK

snaps fingers You know I almost forgot

I saw that Pied Piper is in the StartUp Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt

It inspired me to call TechCrunch and offer to be their keynote speaker

They were quite accommodating

Especially when I said that Id make the event the grand unveiling of Nucleus

So I will see you all at the conference

forced chuckle

This is displeasing

I have never seen him so incensed

What the hell were you thinking Richard

How could you not tell us you entered TechCrunch Disrupt

I applied before I even met you guys

I wasnt gonna say anything because I was gonna withdraw

No youre not

Im not Why not

Because of you Gavin Belson is debuting Nucleus at TCD

If you pull out it looks like Peter is running away from Gavin

So like it or not you are presenting a live demo in front of the world in eight weeks

A live demo of what

I entered TCD with an early build of Pied Piper when it was still just a music app

No Sorry Executive decision we are not doing TechCrunch

OK So let me just tell you whats gonna happen

Peter will pull all of his support and pass on any further funding which as you know is the most flaming signaling risk on earth

Youll burn through the rest of your runway no one will step in then youll go bust

sighs I dont get it

Doesnt Peter Gregory want whats best for the company

sighs

Look Im going to be straight with you

Peter Gregory doesnt care

About

You

Wait Just him or both of us

Any of you Pied Piper

OK

Uh well then why did he back us

Does he just want to piss off Gavin Belson

He spent two hundred thousand dollars just to

Yeah thats nothing

Peter would spend millions just to mildly annoy Gavin

These are billionaires Richard

Humiliating each other is worth more to them than well make in a lifetime

chuckles I see

And you conveniently forgot to mention any of this when you were convincing me to turn down ten million dollars

And now Im in the middle of some pissing contest between two billionaires

In fairness Gavin only offered you the ten million dollars because we started pursuing you

But he offered it to me Monica He offered it to me

Ten million dollars and I didnt take it

Because you came to me when I was puking and freaking out and told me that Peter Gregory believed in me when in reality he didnt even give a flying fuck

Richard

Oh my God

I didnt turn down ten million dollars because of Peter Gregory Monica

I turned it down because of you

However angry he is I am onetenth as angry

Because one of the ten million wouldve been mine

Because I I own ten percent

I know

Of Pied Piper

I know

door rattling

Its push

sighs We didnt think we were going to get this thing done when we had five months to do it Now we have two

Granted its not ideal but were just gonna have to

What the good fuck

Richard What is happening Is that Dinesh

Erlich Is that the Statue of Liberty

And its Theres penetration

Oh Hey neighbor

Ashleys getting big

Aw

She looks What do we do

I dont know Paint over it

No no no You cant paint over it

Its like the code of the streets

People get shot behind that

Oh good

Hey So what do you guys think man

Uhh I think Erlich had a few thoughts

So I gotta Ill let you

Uhh

Heres the headline theres a lot right with it

A lot of good stuff in there

But I just

Do you think the piece is working

I mean Maybe its a bit too graphic for the space

No way Look at it

It comments on the Latino struggle for justice in America

But even without all the symbolism its just aesthetically pleasing

Yeah

All right heres the real shit Chuy

Uh you know our prize coder hes actually not Latino

What

Yeah Point of fact is hes Pakistani

Homes you lied to me

No no no You thought he was Latino and I thought I would be racist telling you you were wrong

Come on man Why would you think that

Thinking that now thats racist

God I cant win with that

Look Chuy painting a guy named Dinesh Chugtai as an Aztec warrior just doesnt make sense

Yeah You know what

I think you might be right boss

Great Thats

So Perfect So change that and then dont have him be fucking the literal symbol of freedom

And then whatever else you wanna do

All right

All right

If I had known we could have withdrawn your application before any of this happened

This is exactly why we need to have clearer lines of communication

I know Jared I know

Listen Id like to institute an organizational system called scrum

Scrum is designed to

Dinesh All right you have one hour Go

sniffing No

No Just musty

Uhh whats going on

Gilfoyle bet me a hundred bucks that if I touched one object in this room he could find it just by sniffing

OK Not now please

It has to be now I just masturbated to heighten my focus

I have a fifteenminute refractory period

Ow

Uhh well we have a lot of work to get done So maybe we should do that instead please

Dude relax OK

We each ripped through a full module this morning

Were just taking a little break

DRM is now a thing of beauty

Wait You did DRM

Yeah

I did DRM

Why did you do DRM I said I would do DRM you would do error handling

Anything to do with error sounds like your whole vibe

Dinesh Yeah I handle errors like you every day

Scrum

Yes scrum

Scrum chuckles

So from rules based filtering we got to workflow at which point that card is moved from the icebox into the in progress column and it stays there until it is ready for testing

OK This increases visibility into our teams progress

And that gentlemen is scrum

Welcome to the next eight weeks of our lives

This just became a job

OK so here are the cards Im adding under this epic for the ingestion engine

And there are three stories here

How long do we think each one will take

I dont know Who cares Four hours apiece

Yeah Maybe for you

Each of those tasks would take me three max

Not tasks stories

Ive got a story why dont you choke on my balls

Well how about this

Why dont you each take one story right and well see whos right

You see what hes doing right

Hes trying to get us to compete so we work faster

He thinks this wall of Psych 101 MBA mindcontrol bullshit is going to motivate us

Fine Dont compete Do them at whatever speed you like

Uh Jared

Uh I know these guys

I really dont think scrum is gonna work for them

Whoa Just trust in the system

So were just going to work at a nice leisurely pace right

Gilfoyle Sure

types faster

Wait why are you typing faster

Im not

Maybe my leisurely pace is just a little faster than yours

whispers Cocksucker

chuckles

Booyah

door opens

Guys Have you been out front yet

Cause you might wanna come see this

Im good

fuck off were working

Wow This took a lot of work

Erlich I mean Im already smiling

Did he really have to paint me giving the thumbsup

Its gratuitous

Really Thats the gratuitous part

Well and Dineshs shaft

police siren chirps

Oh no

Uh

Erlich Oh shit

sighs

Are one of you the homeowner

Yeah I am

Weve had a number of complaints about your artwork here

Look what you do inside the house is your own business

Oh no We dont We dont do that

Oh no

But that is you is it not The individual on the right

Yeah

Youre gonna need to paint over this

Oh I dont think the artist would like that hes Latino

Was that racist

Why are you asking me

Oh I mean I couldve asked anybody but your race

Richard It doesnt matter I have a solution

We put it up

garage door opens

We dont put it down Leave it up

No no no No no no Close it

No

sighs

Look at this left from the previous tenant

Unbelievable I cant believe I didnt enter the garage until this point

I mean is that marijuanas

Were gonna need to take those

Or we leave them and wait to see if the criminal returns to the scene of the crime

What do you say please

OK So I keep the mural and I keep the ten Gs

What do you get

I just thought when I got a new garage door maybe you could come and paint a new logo

Something just as artistic but maybe a little less challenging

Hey Dont look under there Get away from there

Thats not me

laughing

Um just to be honest with you like I really really really need this

So Im trying to be vulnerable in front of you

I dont know Is this a safe place

Look you can be vulnerable esé but this aint a safe place

A plumber got stabbed just last week right where youre standing

What Jesus Christ

What Why would you stab a plumber

sighs All right It was worth a try

Thanks anyway Chuy

Wait Just go ahead and leave the mural

I like looking at it

And plus I think I know what kind of logo you white boys might like

Uh thats amazing Thank you Chuy

Uh yeah Appreciate it

All right man

Yes one of those too

All right

Another one down

Did you really

You still working on that last one

Take your time Theres no rush Dinesh

Feeling pretty happy about yourself

Im pretty happy with ourself

knocking on door

Hello

Hey is Is Richard here

I dont know

Hey

Hey

Come to check up on your investment

Listen you were right

I played you a little

Maybe a lot I got caught up in making the deal

All right And I would like to say I was just doing my job but thats the excuse that the Nazis used so Im not really sure how effective that one is

Your point being

Im sorry

But Im also not sorry

The reason I pushed Peter to seed you is I think you have an unbelievably good platform

Way better than the rest of his other compression plays which I apologize for not telling you about

Look I know eight weeks isnt a lot of time to get this ready but I get the feeling youre the kind of guy that does better when theres a fire lit under his ass

Its a pretty big fire

It is

And by the way youre the only one of Peters companies that Ive invested ten percent of my annual salary in

So I really hope that you can do this

Uh well you know I guess well find out

I saw the logo out front

I didnt know it was

Cool Guys the new logo

Can we please both go

You go first

continues typing

I love it

Erlich Well its lowercase but at least it isnt racist

Is it

Its Chuy Ramirez Im impressed

He sold a mural today for a halfmillion bucks

It wasnt on a garage door was it

sighs

You dont think its too incendiary for the offices

Kevin you got where you are by challenging sensibilities

You know me well

It is pretty raunchy though
