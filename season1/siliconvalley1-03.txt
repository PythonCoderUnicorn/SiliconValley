Gavin The greatness of human accomplishment has always been measured by size

The bigger the better

Until now

Nanotech

Smart cars

Small is the new big

In the coming months Hooli will deliver Nucleus the most sophisticated compression software platform the world has ever seen

Because if we can make your audio and video files smaller we can make cancer smaller And hunger And AIDS

Dinesh What an asshole

Why would he announce it so far ahead of the actual rollout

No one does that

Hes got to be doing it just to fuck with us right

I actually think were ok The player I gave them was from a retired repository that was audio only

Video compression is a completely different paradigm

What they have is like Pied Piper but not as good

People will see that

Not if they get to market before us

Inferior products win out all the time

Like Jesus over Satan

I was going to say VHS over Beta

Ok well actually this is a superior product right here

Is it a margarita machine

Its better

My first official purchase as CEO of Pied Piper

Thats not really our logo is it

It looks like a guy sucking a dick and hes got another dick tucked behind his ear for later

Like a snack dick It does

No its its Pied Pipe

Here put them on

Gilfoyle come on

I dont want it

Jared I bought these tshirts with my credit card but I think Im close to being maxed out so

Yeah um we may have a little problem there

Peter Gregorys check So

So its made out to Pied Piper Incorporated

I checked with the Secretary of State website and theres already a Pied Piper operating in California

So we need to change our name

Thank God

Praise the dark lord thats great news

No its not great news We love the name Pied Piper

Its a classic fairy tale

Well I looked it up

Its about a predatory flautist who murders children in a cave

It has all of that going for it Richard and I still hate it

Richard if we are going to change the name we need to do it now

Names stick My names only Jared because Gavin called me that on my first day

My real name is Donald

But Jared we already bought the tshirts

I cant take these back It was an online order

What is that atrocity

What are we an Irish Prngrphy company

I thought we were gonna replace the name Pied Piper

I thought it was a Place Holder

PlaceHolder would honestly be a better name than Pied Piper

Richard Ive actually been holding off telling people Im the cofounder of Pied Piper because frankly its a little embarrassing

Well um just to remind you you are not the cofounder

So please dont tell anyone

Richard take Aviato Thats not a name I found its a name that found me on a vision quest

Something that you should do

No no Im not gonna eat a bunch of drugs and sit out in the desert and hope some name randomly pops in my head

Well then I question your leadership

Richard a name defines a company

It has to be something primal something that you can scream out during intercourse

Like Aviato

Moaning Uuuuber

Moaning Gooooogle

Moaning Huuuuuulu

Exactly right Moaning Pied Piper

Im so sorry Your voice doesnt really reach that register when you ejculte does it

No its just everyone was doing it I was just chiming in

Sighs

Techno music playing

You guys we cant change our name

I cant go into Peter Gregorys office with a new name and ask him to cut me a new check

I mean hes pulled funding from companies for a lot less

Uh the Pied Piper name and trademark are registered to a sprinkler company in Gilroy

I guess you could head out there and talk to them

But they may refuse

Ok No no no Ill negotiate with them

No offense Richard but youre not a strong negotiator

Im a great negotiator Dinesh

Youre a terrible negotiator

Im a decent negotiator

Just so

Oh Peter youre here Uh

We were supposed to meet 40 minutes ago with the guys from Astraphile about the emergency capital injection

As we discussed our North Carolina plant went sideways

So we need 15 million now or well have to shut down

Have any of you ever eaten at Burger King

Yes Chuckles

Why

Well I was just driven past one

And while I know their market cap is seven billion dollarsplus I realize I am unfamiliar with their offerings

Ok fine

But what does that have to do

Is it popular among your peers

Is it enjoyed

People seem to like it

Yeah its ok

And their selection consists solely of these burgers of which they are presumably king Chuckles

They have other things Chicken fish

Im sorry What are we doing here

Laughs nervously

Here is what we will do

Monica have one of the assistants go to the nearest burger king location and purchase one of everything

Jared Hey Dinesh Dinesh

Im on the phone with the bank and they say they need an extra form for your payroll because of your visa

Visa What visa

Im a fucking us citizen

I have Dinesh Chugtai here and hes pretty irate because

Oh I see

Bertram Gilfoyle is the foreign national citizen of Canada

Ok thank you

Youre Canadian

Your borders are merely a construct

I prefer to think of myself as a citizen of the world

Do you mind just sending them the form so they know youre here legally

Yes I mind

And also I may not be

To wit maybe you could make out my checks to cash

Or bitcoin

I didnt know I was working with an illegal

The irony

Well sometimes we do center pivot but mainly we do lineal like you see out there

What is it your business does again

Something to do with algebra

Uh algorithm actually

Its for compression

Ultimately what were trying to do is

Chuckles You remind me of my son

Hes got aspergers too

Oh no I dont uh

Probably all those pesticides they put on the crops

Well whatever it is your business does I dont think its going to interfere with my irrigation company here

Im thinking about getting in another line of work anyway

All these foreigners coming over here putting pieces of shit like that all over the good farmland around here

All so people can sit around stare at their phones all day

Nobody jerks off to magazines any more

Uh well actually that is a server farm

What we do compression would mean fewer of those because wed save a lot of memory space

Really

Yeah

Well Im all for that believe me

Ill tell you what

You can have the name for a thousand dollars

Hows that sound

Uh that sounds great

Yeah cool Chuckles

Oh tremors too huh

Just like my boy

Phone rings

Go for Erlich

This is Richard Hendricks CEO of Pied Piper

Thats right You guys said I was a bad negotiator but I closed it

We got a name Tell everyone you know

Oh all right

You dont sound that impressed

Erlich No no I am

I just

Now were Pied Piper So later

Here you go

You must drink a lot of margaritas huh

We will now

I have a startup that just got funded so this is just kind of a gift for my guys to celebrate

Hup

Good luck with that

Youll need too it when this town kicks you in the balls

Ok Sure

Let me get the door for you

I had three startups myself and I couldnt get those sand hill road morons to fund any of them

Cowards My last company was genius

Have you ever been lost in a parking lot before

Uh

What app would do is use existing AvL technology right

So youd type in the VIN number And if you car didnt have AvL capabilities you would just type in whatever section of the parking lot you were in like P3 or ground seven

So you just you just write down what section of the parking lot youre in

Why do you need an app for that

So you can remember where you parked

Right uh but why dont you just write it down on paper

Well yeah But this is for your phone

Ok so its just sorta like notepad

Exactly See You get it

Yeah I get it

Why cant all those fucking VCs

Chuckles

Pussies man

Oh there we go thanks

Grunts

This is which one

The BK double stacker

Fascinating

Peter I know that you are incredibly busy with this

But I made a personal promise to the Astraphile guys that none of their employees would lose their job which will happen at midnight to

Do you see this

The junior whopper

No not the sandwich

This seed Atop the breading

Those are sesame seeds

A high number of these breadings have sesame seeds on them

Billions of breadings

Sesame seeds

They only grow in certain microclimates

Peter I know you dont want to cause a hundred and seventy three people in North

Cicadas

Gentlemen

Hey

Its our own personal Herb Cohen

Who

Herb Cohen

Hes a famous negotiator Wrote a bunch of textbooks

No

What

Have you seen the blogs

Richard No

Erlich went ham on all the tech sites

He hit TechCrunch Recode and PandoDaily

Listen to what Kara swisher says

Individually says Erlich Bachman We are formidable

But when you combine our portfolios Peter Gregory and I account for billions of dollars in assets

We at Pied Piper look forward to giving Gavin Belson and the donkeys at Nucleus a run for their money

Chuckles What a dick

Phone rings

Its the guy with the name

Hello Arnold

Cut the shit

I just read Recodenet

You read Recode

I do when my customers tell me the name of my companys all over the Internet

But youd probably think Im just out here sh1tting in a hole and wiping with my hand

No no no I dont think you do that

Do people think you do that Do you do that

Arnold No no no

Im not falling for that phony mumbleymouth googlyeyed routine again

If youre this tech billionaire why did I give you the name Pied Piper for next to nothing

You played me

You want the name its going to cost you 250 grand

Ok I think you just need to talk to the guy who said all that

And he can clear it up for you

Wheres Erlich

Hes outside with the intern

What intern You got interns

We might as well have interns we hire illegal aliens

What

No no We dont have either of those things

Ill tell you what asshole you use the name Pied Piper again Im going to call my lawyer and were gonna sue the shit out of you

fucking billionaires

Arnold Arnold hello

That sounded suboptimal

Yeah it was

Hey Jared you know who else is Canadian Justin Bieber the htler of music

Do you have a problem with me being Canadian

I do actually

Do you have any idea how long it took me to become a citizen

Did it take you a long time

Im glad I didnt do it then

Typical lazy immigrant

These people think they can just walk into this country

Gilfoyle I did just walk into this country

My car broke down on the ambassador bridge

It took me an extra 15 minutes to get across the border Major hassle

You know htler actually played the bassoon

So technically htler was the htler of music

Sighs

I dont understand I thought you closed the name

Well I guess its still a little ajar I dont know

Who am I Herb Cohen Chuckles

I dont know who that is

Neither do I

Thats a Thats a Jared thing

Hey Make sure to clean off all the gunk off the front bumper ok

And since when do we have an intern program

We dont And when Keith finds that out its gonna be a valuable business lesson for him

What Those are the Pied Piper shirts

Are you Richard

Yeah Yes

Ok look I fucked up What do we do now

Whos we

This morning you rudely reminded me that I wasnt a founder of this company and now you want me to hold your hand and help you out




    push

I dont think so sister

This credit card is no good

Declined

Sighs Great Great

That stupid margarita machine maxed me out

So now the CEO of Pied Piper cant even afford to buy lunch

Yeah I dont think we can use that name anymore

Dude Dude hey I owe you a big apology man

I had no idea who you were before and I read all this coverage about your company online and I was like Hey Pied Piper

I met this dude He came into the store and told me my parking app was fucking awesome

Stutters I did

Yeah so my mom was like Wow really

You should really pursue it

And I was like Yeah I should

The parking app

So she decides to get a reverse mortgage on her home and write me a check

Ooh

So Im funded

Because of you man

I was this close to giving up and now you gave me my dream back man

But

Oh hey Ron

You see this guy This billionaire here

Hes the reason why Im quitting Chuckles

Jamie you dont

Well youve helped me so much what can I do for you

Gulps Well I need to return this machine because Im broke and I need money for food

Just a quick question

Uh is this gonna be a cash return or does it credit back to the card

All right what about Smaller spelled SMLLR

You know because we make things smaller and this would be like a smaller version of the word smaller

It looks like Smeller

Ok

What if we spell it

SMLR

Because thats an even smaller version of the word smaller

Then it looks like Smiler

Were not gonna kick the shit out of Nucleus with Smiler

Wheres Richard Why isnt he in here for this

I think he was out back wishing hed taken the ten million dollars

No I just saw him in his room wishing he had taken the ten million dollars

You know smiler is also something that guys call womens assholes

Door opens

Richard why arent you in there coming up with new names

I dont want a new name I want Pied Piper

But apparently I cant have that

So now I have to come up with a new name and take that to Peter Gregory and ask for a new check hes gonna know pull our funding Gavin Belsons going to crush us and we will be ruined because I have no idea what Im doing

Neither did Zuckerberg when he was running Facebook at 19

You think he had any realworld business experience No None

But he was such a tough negotiator that now all of his friends are suing him

How awesome is that And Steve Jobs

He took a shitton of hallucinogens

What a coincidence

Maybe something that you could actually do

Im not going on some fucking vision quest

Ok let me get this straight you would rather do nothing than something

Because all the guys in the other room coming up with shitty names like Smallulator are at least doing something

Sighs

Fine Ill just do it myself

Ill be back in 24 to 72 hours

Have a cold pitcher of water and some orange slices ready for me

You know what Im really gonna go for this mtherfucker so you better have some grapefruit ready too

Im gonna come back with a name so amazing that Peter Gregory will write us ten checks

Cell phone beeps

Sir

Are you ok in there

Making the world a better place

Hes been in there all night

I should call the sheriff

Making the world a better place

No I hey I told you hes going to handle it

Mr Gregory this is ridiculous

Sir

Mr Gregory we need an answer and we need it now

Yes

We need money Now

And Im sure that burger king and sesame seeds and whatever else youve been mumbling about in here all seem lovely to think about

Myanmar and Brazil

No no No more of this

Ok are we getting the money or not

Will you please tell us what the hell is going on

Amusing coincidence that two of the three countries that provide the worlds sesame seeds have such large cicada population no

The cicadas of Myanmar emerge every 13 years while the Brazilian cicadas emerge every 17

Next year they will hatch simultaneously for the first time in 221 years

Crops from both countries will be decimated

Unlike Myanmar and Brazil Indonesia has no cicada population

I was surprised to see Indonesian sesame seed futures priced so low

I made a purchase

And now if the shortage spikes the global price even ten percent Well profit

Evan

Sixtyeight million dollars
