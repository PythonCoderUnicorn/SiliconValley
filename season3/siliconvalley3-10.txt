How the fuck does something like this happen

How does an elephant just die

He was very old and depressed

Hed recently been rescued from the circus but as it turns out he actually really loved performing

Who gives a fuck about the elephant

What about me

This does not look good

Im having a bit of trouble figuring out how to remove him

He weighs 9000 pounds

Cut it up

Take it out in pieces

I I dont mean to interrupt but but I could call in a personal favor and get a helo crew out of Travis AFB with a Sikorsky Skycrane to airlift it out and drop it in the ocean right after dark

No muss no fuss

There

Was that so hard Patrice

Because Hoover sure didnt think so

I mean I just found my footing again and you put me in danger of losing it all over some fucking elephant

Gavin you always said that here at Hooli In order to achieve greatness we must first achieve goodness

Right

So

So

I was a bridesmaid at Sean Parkers wedding when he handed out live bunnies as plush toys

That wasnt goodness

It was badness

And so is this

Youre using endangered animals just to make points at board meetings

Im drawing thoughtful zoological comparisons

But couldnt you just show them a picture of these animals

A simple Hooli search would yield thousands of choices

Patrice I thank you for your honesty and I will repay you with my own

I honestly never want to see you in my offices again

Youre fired

Hoover

Scramble that Skycrane

Hoover Yes sir

THEME MUSIC PLAYING

Please uh come in

Come in Have a seat

I wont take a lot of your time

I promise

Okay

Would you like some tea

I can put a kettle on the hot plate

Oh no Im fine Thank you

Theres no trouble

You know what I have a box of of Russell Stovers if the spiders didnt get into em

Jared is this about the fake users

You know

Two days ago I wanted to look at user behavior to figure out what spurred the sudden uptick and uh well I noticed something

Almost all of our new users were just uploading a single photo into a shared folder and then the next day they would take the photo out and then put it back in the day after that and thats it

You know just enough to qualify as a daily active user

Classic clickfarm behavior

And then I remembered our conversation in the bathtub and it just it had to be you

Richard I am so sorry

Its okay

Would it make you feel better to to strike me

No You you had good intentions Jared

Honestly dont give it another thought

Just you know you and I right now are the only ones that know about it

Okay

And in a few weeks when we run out of money this will all be over anyway

Richard

Yes

We have a secret

Yeah

Erlich I mean I swear to god your dicks would have blown out of the back of your assholes if you had been there hand to God

Hey guys Whats going on

Richard sit down I did it

I saved the company

What do you What How

Jared have you been crying

Yes but for ordinary reasons

Please go on

Erlich Okay

I was at The Rosewood for lunch

I mean it was the lunch hour

I was there I wasnt eating the usual

So I walk over to Andreessen and I say something funny but he stonefaces me

What did you say

It doesnt matter The point is it was hilarious but he gave me nothing and neither did his friends

Then I realized why

Youre not funny

No Gilfoyle but that is

No its that everybody thinks Pied Piper is in this death spiral so it would be inappropriate to laugh at my hysterical joke

And it hits me

I know something that they dont

I know about the uptick

The uptick

Yes the uptick

The recent sudden surge in users

CHUCKLES Yeah That

Yes that So while our fortune is rising everybody else thinks that its plummeting and I can use these opposing forces to a multiplying effect like a slingshot and then I make a decision

Im gonna make a move

So I say something cryptic about the uptick and I walk away

What did you say

I dont know I cant remember

But I walk over and I see McNamees having the short rib which I hear is delicious but not too heavy and then I say to him Youre gonna have to tuck in your tiedye if you want to eat here CHUCKLES

Uh hows that relevant

Its not

But the people that I just walked away from dont know that

All they know is that Im over there exchanging witty banter with McNamee and about what they dont know

Its all that they do want to know

And then it settles in

FOMO

The fear of missing out

Suddenly it feels like time is slowing down

I could see every move I was going to make 12 steps ahead

It was like I was Bobby Fischer if he could really fuck

I go outside I walk across the street to Graylock I check in on Instagram Vinod Khosla calls me asks me what I doing there

I say I cant talk right now Call me at Wood Opal

Well he does and then suddenly Wood Opal is going Whats Khosla got going on with Bachman

Meanwhile Im taking a leak at a Restoration Hardware

I jack off a little bit I dont cum

And then it snowballs

I deftly played Ross Loma against Index Ventures

And because of that the big kahuna bites

Sequoia

I spend the next 20 minutes denying calls from Jim Goetz over and over

And yes Im jacking off but I dont need to ejculte because by the time I listen to the messages Ive got offers Ive got counters Ive got countercounters

I cum

When the dust settled and the losers went home all that was left was this

Hello Mr Bachman Coleman Blair Partners would like to offer Pied Piper a Series B round of 6 million on a 60 million valuation

Oh

QUIETLY Yeah

Holy shit

And this asshole wanted to pivot to video chat

Still valid

Although less sexy now I'll concede that

Its my Mona Lisa

And the entire cornerstone upon which I built this mtherfucking cathedral that I will forever be remembered for was this beautiful little uptick

I think I have a bottle of Cold Duck in the crisper

Whos drinking Come on

I got a bottle of Martinellis for you Jared

This is a big day CHUCKLES

We did it Yes CHUCKLES

Dinesh Are there any wine coolers

I'll talk to him

I I'll talk to him

Heres my Hooli badge

And I have a hanging tag on my rearview mirror for the parking structure

Can I just mail that in

No you need to go get that now

Okay

Hey Dinesh

Im just um looking for Erlich Have you seen him

Oh he went to the liquor store

Gotta keep the party going you know

Oh yeah Yeah Series B Crazy right

Oh its unreal

Yeah

Almost like some of our users

What

What what does that mean

Oh unreal has so many meanings

Fake paid for

one person in Bangladesh pretending to be 6000

Okay Um

All right Dinesh um

Oh no

I dont want to know a fucking thing

Okay then Great

I wont tell you anything because nothing happened

Great

Okay

GASPS But if something did happen and were not saying it did the fact remains that leaves us in a very advantageous position

Theres a lot of money on the table

And it would be a shame if that went away

You know what else would be a shame

CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY is if I couldnt find my flash drive

Gilfoyle have you seen my flash drive

Right the one with the zombie script on it

Why yes the zombie script that randomizes user action in platforms such as Pied Piper

Gilfoyle You mean so that fake users and click farms would be absolutely indistinguishable from real users

Oh I suppose

I mean especially during due diligence like the kind done by VCs or possible future reviews done by certain regulatory bodies

It also had photos of my auntie

Anyway Gilfoyle have you seen it

I have not

Mm well Richard keep an eye out for it will ya

Hey Gilfoyle you wanna come inside and help me get a new flash drive on w wwwstaplescom w 

Yeah I think were sort of done with the ruse

Okay

Okay fine Well whatever you did or didnt do that was serialkillerlevel shit

Agreed

I think I finally respect you as a CEO

DOOR CLOSES

fuck

This is fraud

Is it

I mean our our platform does exactly what we say it does

Okay Its not like were lying about it like fucking Theranos

And if our platform works which we know it will we will make them billions of dollars

Everybody wins Jared

You still believe that right

That if given enough time the platform will catch on

Richard dont weaponize my faith in you against me

Your faith made all this possible

Its wrong

Well every time I try to do the right thing I get fucked

And if I do the right thing here were done Thats it

Doesnt seem like much of an option does it

You may want to fund that instead

In fact why dont I um why dont I just go home I'll grab my laptop I'll come back here I'll show it to you guys

Cause it

Im gonna sign it Can I sign it I'll sign it

You can if you want but we still need his signature

Richard sign it

Thats two years of runway

Sign it now

I cant

Why the fuck not

Because the numbers are fake

What

What What do you mean

What do you

We bought fake users from a Bangladeshi click farm

The uptick was fake

But the the vid chat is real

Erlich the fake users were just meant to cheer the guys up

I had no idea you were gonna take those numbers

And what and go do my fucking job

Pour everything I had into getting the best possible deal for Pied Piper because I believe in them

Well thats all over now

Richard we are fucked

In the amount of time that it took for us to get from that office to right here every VC in the Valley knows about this

If I signed those term sheets I would be committing fraud

Thats a fucking crime

Youre saying you wanted me to

No I wanted you to fucking think about that before you paraded me around the whole fucking valley to sell your lie

And then suddenly grew a thick girthy conscience and fucked me with it




    push

Are you Richard

Did you order an Uber

Oh No

All you had to do was keep your fucking mouth shut and sign that piece of paper

We would have fixed it afterwards

But you didnt You caked your pants

No better yet you caked my pants

fuck you Richard Hendricks

fuck you

Richard Hendricks huh

Prick

TIRES SCREECH

TIRES SCREECH

KNOCKING

Hey

Oh hey Monica

Is Richard here I heard what happened but hes not answering any of my calls

We just wanted you to know for the record that we had no idea any of that stuff was going on

Still trying to wrap our heads around it

Point is dont beat yourself up about not seeing it

Im not beating myself up

I hope you dont think were guilty by association because then we would have to think youre guilty by association which we dont

Just want to let you know that we would definitely work with you again in the future

Its good to know Guys thanks

Um is he in his room

I mean he said he was

But

Im gonna go to his room

Mmhmm

PHONE CHIMES

Uh whats up Gleb

I hear uh Richard shit bed huh

So the platform is no goooooooo

fuck now the vid chats fucking up

Odd considering who wrote the code for it

Not the code The server is overloaded

How is that possible We only gave it to like 12 people

Well theres a few more than that using it now

Holy shit

For what its worth Richard I think you did the right thing

And I can see now why you didnt want to come to us for funding

You were trying to protect us

Yeah

Well I really appreciate it

Uh Laurie wants out

Even a whiff of fraud is a mortal sin for VCs

She needs to wash her hands of any Pied Piper business

Shes forcing a sale

fuck

Yeah frick

Yeah

But it is an open auction and you know between the fraudulent numbers and the real numbers you guys arent exactly killing it out there

So there is a chance that no one will bid and you might be able to buy back your own company for next to nothing

That will have to be for literally nothing because were out of money

CLANG

Ow

Jesus Are you okay

Yeah were fine

All right I spun together a few more servers

That should handle the traffic

Look at this There are 157 people using it near Gleb

And 400 people using it near Tara in Boston

Yeah I told her to give it to her Satanist friends out there

Looks like she did

She knows 400 Satanists in Boston

The Catholic church really did a number on that town

Hey Erlich remember when Gilfoyle said that my video chat app was a piece of shit and that nobody would ever use it

Well he was wrong Over 4000 times

Wow and you developed that with the Pied Piper IP right

Well then you can kiss that goodbye

Oh fuck

Speaking of Im actually using the first dollars of my blog windfall on a trip to Kainchi Dham Ashram in Nainital India where Steve Jobs famously sought peace and came up with the idea for a little product called the Lisa

Good luck

RICHARDS DOOR OPENS

Richard I'll expect you off the premises by end of day

Monica

I'll see you later

Okay

You know you can stay here for one year Free rent

Erlich JianYang

Gavin Laurie

Ah Gavin

You know Jack of course

That is correct

Um Gavin can we address the elephant in the room

Sorry

Pied Piper

Right Yes of course CLEARS THROAT

I am forcing a sale

Your Maleant dealings demonstrate that youre still pursuing a middleout

Might you be interested in placing a bid

Why would he want to bail out Raviga

You said it yourself our compression play is thriving

Fair enough

You know what Im a completionist

Even if I buy it just to throw it in the garbage Id like to be the one to drive the final nail in the Hendricks coffin

I'll give you

900 for it

JACK CHUCKLES

I believe that is a joke

You know what I like nice round numbers

Make it a million

A million dollars

Gavin Belson gets to buy Pied Piper for 1 million and Raviga gets all of it because of their liquidation preference and I get jack shit

Is that what youre telling me gddmn it

I know this is the last way that you wanted it to end

Im really sorry

Yeah well I I'll see you at the meeting

COMPUTER BEEPS

Is that HooliChat

They fix it or something

That didnt look shitty at all

Actually its its ours

Um the guys hacked it together

I can send you an invite if you want

Yeah Cool Thanks

We got up to 4K users totally organically Oh

COMPUTER BEEPS

Oh shit 7K now

Wow we should have been focusing on this instead

Not that it matters

I mean its all gonna be property of Gavin Belson in an hour so

Thats ironic huh

N no for real Im asking Is it

I dont know I was just smiling

Feels ironic

Hey uh so thank you for uh letting me stay here No worries

Steve says youre welcome to take my spot on the couch until you can find a job and get your own place

Thanks

So uh whens your dad coming to pick you up

Uh a couple of hours I guess

Then were turning right around and going back to Phoenix

You know he said he wants to be able to keep an eye on me and my money and that I need to get a real job to learn the value of a of a hard days night or something like that

Well um I should probably get going to this board meeting

Um and youre probably gonna be gone when Im back so guess this is it

Yeah I guess so

See ya

Oh

Oh

Okay

Okay

All right Cool man

There we go

Richard e even though its the last board meeting and and essentially meaningless thank you for letting me be a part of it

Its an honor

Okay you dont have to keep saying that

DOOR OPENS

Good day all This should be brief

The only item on the agenda is of course the authorization of the sale of Pied Piper to the current high bidder

Three yes votes will approve the sale

And as Raviga controls three of the board seats it seems

Im sorry I

Im not doing it

Oh Monica not again

Im sorry but look Richard has worked too hard and I know that I cant stop it but Im not gonna vote to let Pied Piper become the property of that asshole

Monica I also happen to find him contemptible

But Pied Piper will be sold to the high bidder period

You know what I dont care

You want to fire me fire me

If were not gonna adhere to the values that Peter Gregory instilled then I dont think I belong here

Monica you dont have to do this

Im not voting yes Very well Youre off the board

Excuse me Man

Do you work here

Well it was my first day actually

Everybodys been super ni

Sit

You are now officially on the board of directors of Pied Piper

Oh okay Thats fine I guess

When I point to you you will vote yes

Now I move to vote on the sale of Pied Piper

I vote yes

I vote yes

And Evan

Evan

I cant do it

What Why

Because

Monica

I love you

There I said it

And I could never do anything to make you sad

Oh for fucks sake Do I have to pull the receptionist in here

How does this compare with a typical board meeting

All right stop Everybody just stop

We all know how this is gonna go so lets just get it over with

All right

Um I vote yes There

Okay I approve the sale

Three yes votes Can this please just be done

Very well

I vote yes also

Irrelevant

But thank you

The sale is approved

Pied Piper its IP and all of its assets are now officially the property of Bachmanity LLC

Wait sorry did did you just say Bachmanity

As in Erlich Bachman and Nelson Bighetti

Yes you know them

They wait they they had the highest bid

I received a telephone call approximately 30 minutes ago entering a bid of one million and one dollars with a firm noshop clause

So when you were referring to the person who bought Pied Piper as a contemptible asshole you were talking about Erlich

To which contemptible asshole did you think I was referring

Gavin Belson

Oh

I see No

This meeting is adjourned

I thank you all for your time

CHUCKLES

So Bachmanity it is

ALL CHUCKLE

Thats good

So should we give this thing a shot

DOOR CLOSES

You and Big Head huh

Um sorry you had to cancel your trip

And look I I really appreciate all this

I really think this video chat thing is gonna be something you know

I dont know if youve seen the numbers

You want a number The percentage I give a fuck about you zero

Its trending steady

And of course Ive seen the numbers

This is a business opportunity

Nothing more Big Head was your friend

Just us controlling our own destiny

No the best part of it is I own 50

ERLICH CHUCKLES

Richard Well yes um you and Big Head do own the entire company but I am the founder its my algorithm so Im assuming Im getting my original shares back right

Why would you assume that

Well when a tech company reboots its normal to have a a conversation about restructuring the cap table

Good cause Im the guy that hacked together the video chat app to see if that woman was hot so

Yeah but its not gonna scale until I get in there and scrape all the Dinesh off

Well Laurie still hasnt called me back so I may need a new job

And Im assuming Pied Piper cant afford my salary so I'll need stock

Do we really want it to be called Pied Piper anymore

No yes Of cour of of course we want

Why do we want to change the name Its great

Yeah and we do already have the jackets
