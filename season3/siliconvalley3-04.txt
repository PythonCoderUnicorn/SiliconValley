Quite a plan you boys cooked up here

Quite a plan

Im not sure what upsets me more that I have four employees that conspired to commit felony fraud or that I have four employees that are so stupid I found out about it within 30 seconds

Hearing it out loud the first one seems worse

We got sales manufacturing design assembly logistics teams theyre all ready to go

All of them on the payroll all of them here to build me a box

I have a deal in principle with Maleant to buy the box

The second that we deliver a product that meets those specs we are cashing checks

And you are the only four people in this building that are fighting me on it

So give me one reason why I dont fire you right now claw back your options make you unhireable all over town one gddmn reason

Because you cant

Excuse me

This agreement says that you have ten weeks to complete a working prototype before the deal expires

So how are you gonna do that if you fire us

There are maybe eight engineers on earth proficient in middleout compression

Five of them work for Endframe your competition and three of them are here in this office right now

So if were gone I dont think youre ever going to get your box

What do you want

I want to build my platform Now

To complete the box project is going to take six months at least

So what I think maybe we should do is um take a little tip from your chart there and we uh compromise

Compromise is the shared hypotenuse of the conjoined triangles of success

Mmhmm yep So uh so what Im proposing is we stand up the prototype thats it

Were not doing any custom features no new versions no maintenance nothing

Richard the Maleant basement

And no onsite support I think you can hire other engineers to do that fucking mole monkey work

The second we write code that satisfies the basic minimum requirement of the deal we are off the box and on to the platform

And that is my final offer

So what do you say to that action

Whoa

Ow Ow

Hey hey You okay You were standing and then what happened

Its just a little shocking

Oh what were you saying

Did you do we have a deal or

Yeah Richard we have a deal

You have a bloody nose

That was pretty badass Richard

Until it wasnt

THEME MUSIC PLAYS

Uh this is not even a room This is a hallway

Uh it cant be because that is a bed thus this is a bedroom

Two entrances and exits cross drafts ahoy

And uh it is the safest room in the event unlikely of a fire

Oh Whoopsies Dont mind me

Ah Fred this is Jared He actually is a uh a temporary resident

Oh uh while I have you there were fresh droppings near my cot

I think you were right The Havahart traps dont seem to be working

I was thinking maybe we could just pick a day and just drench it in hawk urine because the scent of a predator can keep rodents at bay

Its funny were named Pied Piper but were beset with rats

Little rascals CHUCKLES

fuck this Ive been writing quick bullshit subpar code for 48 hours and I want to kll myself

How do you do it every day Dinesh

What a coincidence Ive also been writing bullshit code for 48 hours and want you to kll yourself

Guys please Lets just shit this thing out so we can get on to building the platform

Hi

Hi

Dang

What

Im Dang

Im Dang

Dang

What

My name is Dang

Oh my Im sorry What uh what can I do for you

Im heading the design team thats building the enclosure for the box

Its time for the concept meeting

Concept meeting

Okay Im just going to show you a few pictures and you tell me which ones you like okay

Okay Sure

RHYTHMIC DRUMBEAT PLAYS

Look wait hold on

I thought you were going to show me pictures of boxes

Like data storage devices

Before I can actualize a box you and I need to develop a shared aesthetic vocabulary

Otherwise I have no idea what youre going to want

Um I have a lot of work to do right now

This is work This is my work

What were doing here could actually save time

Okay Sure Yeah Uh

Lets just make this simple

If the box were an animal what sort of animal would it be

Leopard

Butterfly Rhinoceros

Stop Animal Um its a box

Right Okay so if you need an animal make it a box turtle How does that sound

So this is all kind of a joke to you

You know what I dont actually give a flying fuck what this box looks like

Okay if it was up to me I wouldnt even have it in the first place

So look here This is a black rectangle

Make it that All right Because were going to take it and put it in a hole in a subbasement in a data center where no one can see it except for a sad man named John with a ponytail

Okay Just make it a box

And please turn off that fucking music

PHONE DINGS

Call Gavin Belson Cell

PHONE DINGS LINE RINGS

Gavin on voicemail Greetings friend Im not available right now

Please leave a message after the beep

HORN HONKS

Ill get back to you as soon as I can

Richard What the fuck Why isnt this working

Gilfoyles preprocessor and my compressor should integrate seamlessly This should work

I may have made my preprocessor slightly faster than you asked me to Richard

What do you mean How much slightly faster

200 megs per second

You dick

Thats eight times as fast as the specs required

No wonder our modules arent running at the same speed

Why would you do that

I tried to make it slow

I really did But Im not Dinesh

Its very difficult for me to do shitty work

So I added a differencing library and then the whole thing just took off like a rocket

Wait so youre not processing whole files just the changes

Thats actually pretty cool

Yeah I thought so too

Thats why I wrote it

All right well I guess I should just revert back

Right Slow my preprocessor way down

Although Richard couldnt you just rewrite the compressor to make it faster so its compatible

I mean these are minimum speeds right

Just cause making the box sucks doesnt mean we have to suck at making it

Yeah Okay Um heres one idea

Uh what if we actually move upstream and connect the parser

Both directly to the compressor seed functions

Okay CHUCKLES

Well then the whole thing would really fly

Yeah That would rock

Hey Richard do you have a sec I have a uh preliminary render for you

What is that

What do you mean Its a box

Thats not our box is it

Yes Its exactly what you asked me for

You drew a rectangle and said if it was an animal itd be a box turtle

I mean are you just going to do the bare minimum and call it a day

Is that like what you do

You said it didnt matter you said you didnt care

No ones caring about this Im just saying like its just a matter of pride and like selfrespect

I mean thats going to go in brochures man thats like an advertisement to you and the company and everything

I can maybe add some color to it and give the bezel a little slam

There you go Definitely a slam Slam it

Yeah maybe add some more lights

Sure Yeah Well hey uh what are you doing standing around here talking about it

You should go do it you know Go and make the damn thing

Make it a jaguar cause I have a feeling this baby is going to purr

I dont care either but you know I think maybe a gazelle is more like it

Cause its synonymous with speed

fuck that A cheetahs faster

And it kills fucking gazelles

But I really dont fucking care

But definitely cheetah

Or a gazelle

Also dont throw away the whole jaguar thing cause theyre pretty quick too

Or a gazelle

Ah Jared Jesus fuck What are you doing

Sorry I was I was just taking a quiet moment to collect myself

What the hell is all this shit

My tenant has been leaving my belongings in the alley behind my condo to make more room for his tenants

Your tenant has tenants

Yeah CHUCKLES

Hes Airbnbing my Airbnb So if its okay with you I might need to stay a little bit longer um

I can go around the back to get to the bathroom once Freds here

Whens he moving in

Wouldnt we all like to know

Fred Erlich Bachman You said youd get back to me about the room

I dont mean to pressure you but I need you to decide now

In this moment on this phone call

I am literally standing within feet of three potential candidates whose selves I could easily tell to go fuck

Good What do you mean good

What does that mean youre good

What What other incubator Where What is the address

Because I want to send them a fucking nice gift

fucking Miami Vice disgusting architecture

Hey man What are you doing here

What the fuck are you doing here

What do you mean This is my house

Crazy right

This place is huge CHUCKLES

Did you want to

Yes it would be polite for you to invite me into your home and offer me a Push Pop yes

Im sorry Youre telling me that we should spend less time together

Absolutely Chela

Well I have to say this is a big relief

In all candor I was feeling the same but I thought that discussing it with you might be awkward

Not at all

You are ready Chela to stand on your own to weather the challenges of the future and the rumors swirling about your leadership

Be well Gavin

Im Im sorry Wait what what rumors

There is talk that in the face of a growing threat from Richard Hendricks and Pied Piper armed with a powerful new CEO that you have done nothing

LAUGHS Well yes but

That by shuttering Nucleus you have left them to gather strength unopposed ceding the entire space Some are saying this is a show of great weakness

Who Who exactly is saying this

Well people talk

In the halls in the cafeteria on the parking shuttle

Wait should should I be worried about this

The beauty is now you have all the answers

Yes All right

Denpok please

Will you sit back down I need your help

Of course

Thank you

Clearly we have come far but we still have far to go

Not as far as lot D but far nonetheless

Jared Look what you guys built

You cant help but be elegant youre like Audrey Hepburn

Ah here they come

Well I know we made a big deal about just doing your absolute minimum of your specs but one thing led to another and well Jack buckle your seatbelt because Id like to introduce you to

Richard just save it

Just got off the phone with Calvin Greene CEO of Maleant

Theyre pulling out

What

How can they just pull out

Because they shopped our deal and got a better bid from another appliance maker so Maleants out they fucked us

Oh

Yeah

So probably we should just push pause on the whole box thing until we figure out where to go from here

Okay Uh I actually I have a I have a question

Yeah I know I know I know Richard we had an arrangement but that was all based on closing the Maleant deal

So now we have to figure out

No no Sorry um

No my question is uh who did they go with

Whose box do they think is that much better than ours

Oh uh Dectosphere

Dectosphere

Its a brick with a power cord

Yeah But I hear their new 4311s theyre going to be hitting close to 75 megs per second

Uh we can do 200

What

Yeah You think you can get me in a room with Calvin Greene




    push

Big Head This is the pool The first night I was here I turned the heat like all the way up and half the water evaporated overnight Its crazy

Well I hope you own a skimmer because theres a massive turd floating on the surface of your pool

Who Fred Freds great man

Hes got this really cool um malware cataloguing thing

Cut the shit Big Head I see exactly what youre doing

Poaching my tenants You stole my business model

What No Dude its not like that at all

Its just this house has like nine bedrooms

You have any idea how scary that gets at night

So I just wanted to have some roommates around but um you know I felt weird charging them rent cause you know

No I dont

Well its like 20 million you know so I dont really need it but then they felt weird living here without paying me anything so they offered me pieces of their startups Thats all

You just admitted to starting a competing incubator

Ive caught you in a web of your own lies havent I

I dont think so Wait have you

All right Big Head You want to play it that way

If its a fight you want then a fight you shall have

All of you

See you buddy

Big Head

ENGINE SPUTTERS

fuck

What are we doing here

Why are we fighting like this

I mean Im going to steal your guys youre gonna steal my guys

Well both wield the heft of our considerable fortunes until each of us have nearly nothing left

Is that really what you want Me either

So what do you say we join forces

Im big enough

Are you Big Head Partners

Okay

Attaboy

All right Im going to take a spin on that fancy Japanese toilet and then lets get to work figuring out which one of these bedrooms is going to be my office

Gavin Consider the bulldog A grotesque monstrosity born of relentless inbreeding

Riddled with sinusitis crippled by joint pain

Chronically flatulent

A kindly pet or humanitys cruelest mistake

All right take it away

Ladies and gentlemen just like that horrible creature the entire Nucleus program was the result of inbreeding

We mated Hooli engineers with Hooli designers in a Hooli kennel

Is it any wonder the result was just as unspeakable as that thing

Bring it back here

Look at that hideous face

All right get it out of here

Im sorry Gavin Whats your point

My point is just as not all dogs are as flawed as the bulldog not all compression plays are as flawed as Nucleus

Our execution was lacking but the idea was correct

Our only mistake was looking inward

It is now time to look outward

I mean this guy did all of the work

Ten minutes after we leave Calvin Greenes office he calls me up and says Hey you got me How much

I just showed them the box Jacks the one who made the deal

Good feelings happy feelings

So Big Head built a better version of your incubator accidentally

Correct

And he didnt even realize it

Also correct

And your solution to that was to go into business with him

Big Head The guy you once called more useless than a bag of dicks without a handle

Dinesh dont fall for his aw shucks routine

He is a shrewd businessman

And together we have over 20 million and 36000 dollars at our disposal

Now if youll excuse me on to Pied Piper

I have a board meeting and this board aint exactly gonna meet itself

Laurie Our subsequent order of business is the approval of Pied Pipers redraft of the hardware requisition agreement with Maleant Data Systems Solutions

Ah yeah

The main event

Weve all read the latest sales agreement yes

Actually I dont think I was CCd on

So I believe we can move straightforward to a vote

Actually Im sorry I have an issue with uh section 14 paragraph two

Um it states that Maleant has exclusive rights to purchase any appliance made by Pied Piper for the next five years

Oh uh yeah Jack gave them exclusive rights to the box so that we would get a better price upfront

Right but this language is far broader

They actually have exclusive rights to use the underlying algorithm in any form

Oh no Thats not right at all

Yeah so I think Jack were going to have to go back to them and just change the language here

Were not going to be able to do that

And uh why not

Because that was the specific language which Maleant requested when I got them to pay three times as much for each one of our boxes

Its a white label deal so they have the right to resell these boxes in any form they choose

Yeah but Jack if they have exclusive rights to the algorithm then we cant use the algorithm to build the platform

For five years They wanted seven I talked them down

I know but you said that we could build the platform once we gave you the box

Yes but I never specified a timeframe

Are you serious

I save your ass and you stab me in the back like this

In the front Richard

Laurie did you know about this

I did not

Well then good okay

So it wont go through because Lauries not going to vote for it

Richard this is complicated

If one goes strictly by the numbers these numbers you have built a box that is so valuable I am now obligated to vote in favor of it

Laurie this deal is peanuts The platform could be worth a thousand times what the box is worth

It could be correct however

This is theoretical Richard

You dont have a price point I do and she has a fiduciary obligation as a member of the board to vote for the box On the page this is in the best interest of the company Am I wrong Laurie

That is factually correct

You remember when you tried to end run me and kll the box

Well she couldnt do a gddmn thing about it then

And she cant do a gddmn thing about it now

Simple majority ratifies the agreement all in favor

Are you kidding me What the fuck is going on right now

Laurie

I wasnt carbon copied on this particular email so I stand with Richard

Um Richard you know how I voted to fire you a couple months ago

And I said that I did it to stay in the game so that maybe at some point in the future I could do something to help

Well Laurie I know youll probably replace me on the board and call for a revote tomorrow but Im here today

And I dont have any metrics to back it up but I honestly believe that the platform that Richard wants to build will be far more lucrative in the long term than any box

So at least for today Im voting no

Motion denied

We will be reconvening tomorrow

And if I could get a uh an email be CCd on the latest draft

I couldnt sit there and watch them do that to you

I just hope I dont end up fired over this

Well what you did took incredible guts

And the fact that it probably wont make any difference makes it all the more meaningful

Right I saw this nature documentary where a bison fought a lion to protect the rest of the herd And it was so moving

Um it didnt work the lion uh tore into the bison and then laid waste to the herd but what courage

Thank you Jared

You guys just had to make a great box didnt you

You couldnt phone it in

PHONE RINGS

Uh guys Gavin Belson is calling me Again

What the fuck does he want

Hello

Richard Hendricks just checking in seeing if you heard the news

What news

Mm

Obviously you dont have your Hooli news alerts up to date

Go to the site Ill wait

Go to the Hooli news website

Okay

Its an ad

Um its an ad Hold on

Just wait four seconds and you can click to skip it

Just wait four seconds and then you can click it

No its the kind where you have to watch the whole fucking thing

Its the whole ad kind

I thought we stopped doing those gddmn it

Well regardless what youll see once the paid announcement is over is that I just closed a 250 million dollar deal to acquire a little company called Endframe

I thought youd want to know Update those Hooli news alerts

Also I invite you to click yes if our ad experience was relevant to you Be well Richard

What did he say

Oh my God

Gavin Belson announces deal to acquire Endframe a middleout compression platform company for 250 million dollars

Even after they shit the bed with Nucleus Hooli gets to build our platform and we dont

LAUGHS COUGHS

What is funny about this

Hes intoxicated

No No yes but dont you see

Gavin in trying to fuck us just saved our asses

COUGHING

Hes right Hes right

COUGHING

My gosh Oh my gosh hes right

Holy shit

I am so confused right now

Gavin set a p COUGHING

He set the

The price point

Yes

Yes yes yes

Yes thanks to Gavin Endframe a middleout compression platform is objectively worth 250 million dollars

Wait okay We are a middleout compression platform company

Are we worth 250 million dollars

Theres no way the box makes us worth a fraction of that

Laurie couldnt vote for the platform because she couldnt assign a dollar value to it

Well Gavin has just done that

Hes validated the market so theres theres no reason to revote We win

I cant wait to see the look on that AAR pricks face when we come in there and gut him like a COUGHING

Is he okay

Hes going to be fine

Welcome men and ladies of Endframe

Rather than incestuously promoting the same faces from within you represent fresh blood new ideas Everything Nucleus was not

It is my honor to personally welcome you all to Hooli

Does he really not remember us

How long did you work at Hooli The last time

Seven years

I was here for nine He was invited to my wedding

I hope Jack doesnt cry

I really hope he does

Hey Gloria Lynn

Did they both get fired

I dont

Laurie What are you doing here Wheres Jack

Uh as you may recall at our board meeting last night Jack said that he would get his way and that in his words I quote couldnt do a gddmn thing about it end quote

Well in light of recent activities it appears that I could do a gddmn thing about it

And I just did Jack Barker has been exited

fuck me sideways

Indeed

Effective immediately you are all at liberty to commence work upon the platform

Okay Wow

Yeah uh uh I just got to ask um with Jack not being CEO anymore am I CEO again

You are not

Nor are you Mr Bachman

Im sorry if Im not CEO Erlich isnt Jack isnt who is going to run Pied Piper then

Officially and until further notice this chair will remain empty

Really

Excuse me

 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 I dont never feel pain 
 Cause I done felt too much pain 
 Blood flowing through my veins 
 Im just doing my thing 
 Get money baby girl gold chains 
 I dont never feel pain 
 Cause I done felt too much pain 
 Standing in the rain 
 Blood flowing through my veins 
 I aint never did a thing 
 Getting money rocking chains 
 Well never feel the same 
 We the thugs in the game 
 I dont never feel pain 
 18 wheeler gorillas Black with gold chains 
 Pitch bird like steelers 
 Hines Ward of the crime lords 
 Running through this money screaming encore 
 Spending nights with the prime whore 
 But thats the bitch that youre blind for 
 Celebrating on a whim ngga 
 Pain is Pac above the rim ngga 
 My bitch rock a bigger gem nggs 
 Cause she was there when it was dim ngga
