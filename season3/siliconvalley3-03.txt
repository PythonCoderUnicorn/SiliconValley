Here it is

This is your future

One of your Pied Piper boxes would go right here in this rack

Okay SIGHS

Man Okay

Let me show you the next location in which we would install one of your boxes

Gilfoyle Richard What the fuck are we doing here

I dont like it any more than you do

I told Jack wed come check this place out and then wed have a discussion

Dinesh I cant believe you suggested the idea of building a fucking appliance

I didnt okay

I pitched it as an example of what not to do and the fucking sales guys ran with it

I didnt want to go to enterprise

You were the ones who said it would be fine

No we didnt say that

You said it all the time

Thats not what we said That is not

Here it is This is where another one of your Pied Piper boxes would go

Okay Good

Okay Let me show you the next location in which we would install

Actually you know what

Sorry No offense but once you see one space in a rack youve kind of seen them all

Thats what I used to think until I saw them all

Would you like to see your desks

Our desks

What

 

This is where we would install a Pied Piper engineer

Sorry Why exactly would we need to be here

Your sales representative promised 24houraday onsite maintenance at least for the first year

So one of us would have to be down here for a year

Even at night

Theres really no difference between day and night down here so it makes things easy

Okay well we should probably get going Now

Almost right now

Yeah right now even

Okay There are 16 stairwells

Which one would you like to see first

Just whatevers as fast as possible

Your favorite one

Hmm

Okay

 

Oh

You see these fucking mole people

Hey where did John go

Gilfoyle Oh shit Did he go in a room

No Uh probably around here

LOUDLY Hey John

John

Oh Uh John

John

Oh shit

Gilfoyle John

Dinesh Where is he John

John

We cant take my algorithm and put it in a box and bury it at Maleant

We just cant

I think this thing is dead

Jack look I have no doubt that your guys can sell a box and an appliance may be a good shortterm play but in the long term we need to be building our fulltime platform

Gloria

Could you call the fish guy and see what kind of warranty we have one these things I think one of them is dead

SIGHS Jack please

You said that when we got back from Maleant we would discuss this

Okay lets discuss it

Take a look at the Conjoined Triangles of Success

Now what do those two triangles make together

A square

A box They make a box

You cant make that shit up

But you literally did make it up

Yes I did And now they teach it at business schools

But I was only referring to the serendipity of the coincidence

Look if we build you the box will you promise to let us build the platform when its done

Well think about then then

Now we need to worry about now

Build me a box now

 

Howd it go

Uh not well

All right then

What do you What do you mean What are you doing

Well first Im changing my Linkedln status to Looking for work

That box is artless commerce I wont be a party to it

So youre just gonna quit

Just like that How How can you do that

By saying the words I and quit in conjunction together ie I quit

Well theres actually some paperwork involved

Hey can I have that USB missile launcher

Ill just fish it out of the trash later

Richard Gilfoyle come on

Give me some time to figure a way out of this cause if you quit now youre gonna lose all your shares

And what if Barker changes his mind and lets us build the platform

And the odds of that are

CELL PHONE BEEPS

Oh

Already Recruiters move fast these days

This is Gilfoyle Dazzle me

 

More recruiter swag

You got an Oculus

Yup

Thats a hoverboard

How many meetings are you taking

None Thats the irony

The more meetings I turn down the more these recruiters send me

What are you doing

Eating popcorn

Thats my popcorn

You have seven tubs of it

You could be the mayor of Popcornopolis

Dont eat the caramel You can have the cheese or the plain

Youre leaving me with the cheddar

Thats right dick

Hey can I borrow this Just for a little bit

No Whoa whoa hold on

Youre wearing a gold chain

Oh right Yeah Ive had it for a while

Just kind of throw it on every now and then

None of that is true

I definitely wouldve noticed

Okay listen

Ive been working hard Im making money for the first time

I was like buy myself something nice you know

But instead of that you bought a chain

Youre just jealous I have a salary quitter

And you are too legit to quit eh MC Hamas

fuck off

Later Chain the Virgin

Well Gilfoyle looks like your recruiters are gonna have to take back their gift baskets because I just got off the phone with Monica and shes getting me in to see Laurie this morning so I can tell her whats going on

But youre youre going over your CEOs head

That is a serious breach of protocol

I mean if Jack finds out hell be furious

Hey when you push a man so far he goes out buys a gn and shoots everyone in a bank

Whoa

No I wouldnt I wouldnt

Im not Im not going to

Just The point is what other option do I have anyway

What other option do you have Richard

Can I speak with you alone please Hmm

 

Are you angry with me Richard

Have I done something to offend you

No What are you talking about

You know when you and the boys picked up and went to the new offices and didnt invite me along

I didnt say anything

Yeah because you dont work at Pied Piper

And you havent let me forget that for even one moment have you Richard

III Im having trouble tracking this

I dont know what youre mad about

You publicly proclaimed I have to go over Barkers head because what other option do I have

What other option do you have Richard

Uh

Cause there is another option and hes standing here looking you in the face and youre staring back like he dont even exist

Just to be as clear as I possibly can be here are you trying to tell me that you want to talk to Barker

No Richard I dont want to talk to Barker

I want you to want me to talk to Barker

You know at this point if itll make you feel better sure you can go talk to Barker

See

Was that so hard

Actually yes that was painfully difficult

 

Yeah shes definitely dead

Im sorry for your loss Gloria

Gloria Gl Oh

Would you take this daughter of Neptune back from whence she came

The toilet dear Thats okay

What can I do for you Mr Bachman

Ah yes to the matter at hand

I spoke with Richard about the box project and

Well here are some of my thoughts in no particular order

Why a box

What information do I not already have

Im sorry

I said What information do I not already have

I already have a fiveyear run rate plus a full market forecast for my appliance I have the same for Richards platform

Ive heard all of his engineering teams complaints

So before you waste time with some freeform jazz odyssey of masturbatory bullshit just tell me what concrete information you have for me that I do not already possess

 

Richard SIGHS

The way I see it youve got about two options

One you build yourself the box

Two you get Laurie Bream on the phone ASAP

All right Ill see you back at the house

Okay

Ah Hirokisan

SPEAKS JAPANESE

 

Umm What is that one

It is a question mark made of human hair harvested apparently from dead people in India

Its a pun It signifies that at Raviga we ask the big hairy questions

Right Speaking of questions

What should we do about Jack

Well I concur with your assessment that a backup appliance for data centers seems an uninspired application of your technology

I will contact him and well have a frank discussion about this

Great I really appreciate you hearing me out on this

And it goes without saying I was never here

Oh

What

You are here Now

What Richard means is he would prefer if you didnt tell Jack that he came here to talk to you about this

Yes because the other interpretation makes no sense

 

PHONE RINGS

Jack Laurie Bream on line one

WHISPERING Guys Guys its happening Its happening

Hello

Okay Drop the hammer Laurie Bream

INDISTINCT CONVERSATION

What are you doing Hes going to see you looking

I cant see cause of these fucking monitors

Whose fucking fault is that okay

Its not my Shh

Somethings happening

What

Whats happening Whats happening

Oh man Barkers pissed

How pissed Scale of one to 10

Oh my God Seven

fuck

Oh no no no no no Like a nine nine and a half

Dinesh fuck Im missing everything

Im going to go to the kitchen

He doesnt know I could be hungry

SLAMS

Its over Its over

I missed the whole fucking thing because of these fucking monitors

Richard Jack would like to see you in his office

Oh Okay

If youll excuse me gentlemen Im gonna go ask Action Jack how Lauries dick tastes

D No

Yeah

You wanted to see me chief

Sure come on in Richard Grab a seat

Richard Sure

CLICKS

WHIRS

Oh CHUCKLES

Yeah Okay

So guess who I just got off the phone with

Uh I have no idea Who

Laurie Bream

Laurie Bream From Raviga

Exactly She was pretty adamant that the whole box project here at Pied Piper was

SIGHS woefully misguided

Whoa Strong words Wow

In fact it was her opinion that we should immediately abandon the box in favor of the consumer platform version of Pied Piper which I believe you and your guys were bucking for

Oh I dont know about bucking but yeah Yeah well hey look Laurie Bream is the investor

Yeah

She is the investor

Anyway she wanted a comprehensive gotomarket strategy for the platform version within 48 hours

Wow Well what Laurie wants Laurie gets

So yeah We should probably get started on that

No we shouldnt Richard

Were not building the platform

Were building a box

SCOFFS Okay but didnt Laurie say that she wanted the platform

Yes she said that and then I said that if Pied Piper was going to build a platform she would have to fire me

Uh what did she say

She said she was not interested in doing that at this time

And did she say anything after that

Were building the box Richard

Twelve weeks from today were going to present her a prototype of that box

So lets get it done

CLICKS

WHIRS

Okay

Yup

CLICKS

WHIRS

One more thing Richard

If youre going to shoot the king you better be gddmn sure you kll him

You understand what that means

HESITANTLY Yeahar

Did you just say Yar

No

 

Look at us Two rogues on the Kings Highway

Let the rats run in their maze

We chose this This is our destiny

Freedom Isnt that right Gilfoyle

LIGHTER FLICKS

Did you say something

Of course

KNOCK ON DOOR

If its more popcorn tell em were at capacity

Its a guy from Men in Black

Bertram Gilfoyle

Yeah

Im here on behalf of TwenX recruiting Im supposed to give you this

Pappy Van Winkle

Now were talking Ill take it

They told me not to give it to you until after the meeting

I respect your skills

Let me get my jacket

She was supposed to talk Barker out of making the box

What the fuck happened

Richard

What

I was on the call okay She tried he said no

Well then she should fire him

She cant fire him

Why not She fired me

Exactly She cant fire him because she fired you

Firing a young CEO and installing a much more experienced one looks like leadership

Firing two CEOs in a month looks like chaos

Richard look Im sorry but I think the box is here to stay

Okay Lauries gonna have to pretend to be in favor of it

Shell probably issue press releases talking about how its the best application of your visionary technology

Is there nothing that we can say to Laurie to change her mind

If I could control Laurie do you really think Id be looking out my office door at that monstrosity

Jeez Monica hes not that bad

I mean hes a little ugly I guess

Oh the question mark Sorry

 

Mr Gilfoyle Were ready for you

The guys cannot wait to see you again

Again

Marc Gilfoyle

What the fuck

Good to see you again buddy Why dont you have a seat

You stole half of our algorithm

You think you can bring me in here and pay me to give you the rest

Oh No We want you because youre a fullstack engineer

We already paid someone else for the missing piece of middleout

Bullshit

Do you know Naveen and Eric who until very recently headed up engineering at Nucleus

Hey man

Whats up

Nope

Well Im sure you at least recognize the code they brought us

Thats exactly how they had it

Okay So Endframe has our entire prediction loop down to the last fucking semicolon

So Nucleus stole half our IP and Endframe stole the other half

And now theyve knitted them together

So while we are busy building Barkers box Endframe is beating us to market with a platform

So basically we are a fucking mediocre appliance company

At least well make a little money doing it

Oh great So you can go back to the car wash and buy some more chains

Huh Pakistani Mr T

fuck you

Wait Are you not wearing it

Youre not Did you take it off because I was fucking with you

Dinesh No

It was itchy on my neck so

Bullshit

That was a bad decision

You flinched Now the pain will never end

CHUCKLES Im sorry to say it but Gilfoyles right

Youre making it worse Sorry Django

Django

LAUGHS Unchained

Great Now even fucking Jared is busting my balls

I am Im Im busting your balls

Dinesh You know what If youre gonna give me shit for it anyway Im just going to wear it

Richard Okay Jared Congratulations by the way but we have our own balls to worry about all right

Look how are we going to save the platform

What choice do we have Barker is the CEO

We have to do what he says

Or do we

I dont know I dont want to lie down for this okay

I dont want to just give up so easily

Richard unfortunately in this case I think we have to roll over and take it

LOUDLY Or do we

Erlich you have something to say

Richard when George Washington founded a little startup weve come to know as these United States of America and he was tired of getting shit from his CEO the King of England did he just roll over and take it from behind

No He called on his rideordie homeboys Tommy Jefferson Benny Franklin and Alex Hamilton who was halfblack so thats Dinesh

Im not halfblack

He said Avast ye fellow badasses lets build this country the way we mtherfucking want to

And so Richard if we want to build the platform all we need to do is build the platform

That was underwhelming

Perhaps you can go into slightly more detail

We tell Barker exactly what he wants to hear

That way he thinks were being good little boys

But what were actually doing is building the platform Think about it

Whats he gonna do

Call the cops

Actually no

Erlich may be onto something

If all we gave him was the platform Jack would have no other option than to embrace it and say it was his idea all along because at that point he cant tell Laurie the truth

What That he had absolutely no idea what was going on inside of his own company

Hed look like an idiot

And Laurie wants the platform anyway so shed be good for it

SNAPPING FINGERS Okay

We build a skunkworks

A secret company inside the company

We go all Oceans Eleven on his ass

Hold on Oceans Eleven

Its a 2001 casino heist film starring Julia Roberts and 11 men

I know what it is Jared

Im saying not only are we going to have to engineer code and stand up a full platform on our own we also have to make Jack and his sales weasels think were working on the box the entire time

And if we fuck anything up and get caught he could take our stock and probably have us arrested

All right Im in

Well youre insane

No Dinesh that chain is insane

And not in the membrane

Sorry Cypress Halal

LAUGHS

Richard Okay Jared settle down

But this This is fucking genius

Okay how do we even begin to pull it off

Okay Well lets work through it

 

I can generate fake status reports purchase orders deliverables updates and I can liaise with sales to coordinate what custom features we need to pretend to build

Richard Okay great yeah but faking the box is going to be the easy part

Building the platform is the real challenge

Gilfoyle where are we on the server space

Thats gonna be tricky

When we started moving out of the house I dismantled Anton

All the racks GPUs and cables are in storage at the office

Were gonna have to break him out

Thats a shitton of hardware

Unless we do it one piece at a time like Shawshank Redemption or The Great Escape you know

Id have bigger clothing on the day but

Wait

Wait

Ive got a better idea

Lets say these Legos are Anton sad stacks of server components lying dormant in storage

Sneaking all of him out would be too difficult

So if we cant break Anton out maybe we can break in

Richard Stand the servers up right where they are

Can we do that

Easy

I can run cable through the drop panel in the ceiling all the way to the buildings main power panel

When I pull a little bit of power from each of the other tenants no one will know

Guys I hate to keep sh1tting on your campfire but servers are not the real issue

We have a manpower problem

Theres a ton of engineering to be done on the platform

Yeah hes right but we have to pay them under the table

I know just the right man for the job

You guys are fucking nuts but I dig it

Heres the deal Im going to need the back pay you guys owe me for when I was working for free not to mention lost wages from my old job

Oh and damages from when Jared sexually harassed me into being friends with that Monica chick

So all that and youre in

In No

Thats just to keep me from telling Barker about your secret project

What Are you serious

Oh yeah

Well there goes most of our cash

Dinesh We just got extorted for 20000

fuck Carla She was dead weight anyway

Whats next

Gilfoyle I just thought of something

Its a big problem but I think Ive got a solution

Hello this is Bertram Gilfoyle

Yes Im still available and I would reconsider sitting down with you and your clients if you send four large pizzas to 5230 Newell Road in 30 minutes or less

HIPHOP MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO

SHOUTS

 

Okay I think that covers it

Weve thought of everything We have a plan

Everybody in

In

In

fuck yes Im in

And Im in to the idea of taking a bigger leadership role in the company

Were not gonna make the same mistakes

Okay Erlich just just say In

Were all just saying In

Im in volved

Hey you cant spell involved without an in

Just be in Uh Dinesh

All right fuck it Im in but on one condition

Im going to need everyone to solemnly swear that they will no longer make fun of my gold chain

Not a word ever again

Well guys I think we can agree to that

SIGHS DEEPLY

This plan better fucking work with a sacrifice like this

Shall we drink from the teat of Pappy to celebrate

I think I might actually enjoy going to work now

Wait

We cant enjoy going to work

Meinertzhagens haversack

What

Meinertzhagens haversack

No one Really

No ones heard of Meinertzhagens haversack

Of course I have Jared Just explain it to them

Well its a principle of military deception

Essentially it means you have to continue to act the part

So as far as anyone knows were still building a box that we hate

We need to act like it

Thats exactly right

If we do anything differently Barkers going to be onto us

We have to keep complaining about Barker

We have to keep bitching about the box

We have to keep making fun of your gold chain

We have to We dont have any other choice Dinesh

Hes right

Its a shame Bell Biv Dinesh but unfortunately that chain is poison

All right To skunkworks

Hey all right

I dont usually drink at 730 in the morning but LAUGHS

All right

Hey guys look we have to shred everything in this house that pertains to skunkworks

If anyone catches wind of anything that weve done here we are fucked

 

Okay you guys this is it

No turning back now

Dinesh I have a few premium chain insults that Im going to lay on you when we get in there

Not for myself obviously but for the team

I just might have one too Sorry in advance

Yeah Great

 Schemin on house money and the whole show 
 The low pro ho shell be cut like an afro
