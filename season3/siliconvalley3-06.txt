Okay one extralarge virgin margarita

Thank you Richard

What took you so long

Uh I actually uh I met a girl

Its called the bartender she works here

No no Its a real girl

And I actually got her real phone number

Check you out Mr Casanova

Where is this individual Um

Shes right over there

The tall dude

No behind him

Oh she must be hiding behind that attractive girl in the red sweater

No it is the attractive girl in the red sweater

Oh

Can we stop looking at her

Shes magnificent

Are you sure its not the tall guy

Why are we surprised that young Richard is garnering the attention of ladies

After all hes king again Women like that

Okay so shes a founder hounder

Come on no it its not like that

But you did tell her that youre the CEO of your own company

It came up But I mean honestly how else was I going to explain that me and my friends were at a bar

That is a good point

Anytime youre near a woman it is important to explain why

Otherwise they get nervous

Gentlemen

Richard Hm

To Pied Pipers past and now present CEO

Oh what about future

Jared well worry about that later

Tonight its about Richard

To Richard

THEME SONG PLAYS

I think youll find Im a Im a Im a pretty tolerant boss but Gleb your your last commit you did use spaces over tabs

Um I dont know why youd commit to that uh so just tell me why on earth you you would do something like that

Is not so big a deal Theyre very much the same yes

Yes yes hes right Theyre very much the same

No no sorry theyre theyre not the same

At least not in my book Um um one is right and the other is wrong CHUCKLES

Why didnt anyone tell Gleb to use tabs

Yeah we did And its in the company style guide

I just dont think Gleb realized how seriously Richard takes this stuff

Yeah Ive honestly never understood it myself

I mean once the code goes through the compiler theres effectively no difference

I know but coders go like batshit over it

At Hooli I once saw two engineers get into a fight so vicious they almost made physical contact

What

Richard Okay guys uh back to work

Uh Gleb Sanjay everyone do you understand tabs

Yes yes You have made this very clear as clear as crystal

Okay Good thats my little thing and Ill hand you back to Dinesh now

Hes uh hes the man with the plan and the uh pretty cool tan

CHUCKLES

Its not a tan its

Yeah I know I know

Uh sorry

This is how I was born

Hey uh Elisabet Hi

Um before you go I just wanted to say that I thought your last commit was very impressive

Oh Thank you

Almost as nice as the fingers that typed it

LAUGHS

Just call it like I see it

Elisabet Thank you

Speaking of seeing I will see you tomorrow

Elisabet Yes You will

CHUCKLES Byebye Dinesh

Bye Elisabet

CHUCKLES

Yuck

What

You dont actually think she was flirting do you

She works here Shes paid to interact with you

Just like that bartender that Richard thought he was flirting with

Uh actually shes not a bartender

And for your information weve been trading texts

And uh were going for drinks later so

Great If you go to the bar she works at you can probably drink for free

Again uh not a bartender

Okay she works at Facebook So she makes a lot more money than I do or you do

And um shes definitely not a founder hounder So sorry CHUCKLES

Yeah none of that adds up

Hey guys check out CodeRag

What did the Gavin piece post

Indeed it did

Oh Gavin Belsons HooliScrub Scandal

Awesome

Man Gavin cannot be happy about this

PEOPLE SHOUTING

CROWD BOOING

Stay close

Back up back up

Youre on private property back to the sidewalk

Youre gonna get arrested

Hey Gavin

Hello Im

CROWD CHEERING

You know a hundred years ago men like me couldve had people like that klled

Just like that You think captains of industry like Andrew Carnegie or Cornelius Vanderbilt wouldve batted an eyelid Please

SIGHS Times sure have changed

Or have they

Of course they have And for the better

Unless

All right forget it What are we doing about this article

Can we sue this Cantwell woman for libel

Gavin libel laws dont really apply when whats written is true

Its my understanding you did in fact instruct Nucleus engineers to obscure negative HooliSearch

I know what I did

Forget libel What about this unnamed Hooli insider she keeps quoting

Everything this person is saying is obviously covered by a nondisclosure agreement Lets sue that person

We dont know who that person is

And reporters generally dont give up their sources

Well then Ill just have to light a fire under this reporters ass wont I

You know there was a time not so long ago when it couldve been a literal fire

But as discussed those days are gone

Unless

All right forget it You people are useless

Thank you Youre excused

Its Gavin Belson for CJ Cantwell please

Shell know what its regarding

Ehrlich Now the stage should be here

With Yeezy or someone comparable

Now I have yet to land on a theme

Most people who rent Alcatraz for parties tend to go with the prison theme

Hm how much would it cost to make this look as if it were never a prison at all

Spare no expense and if you think it would be cool I would love to have some sort of chocolate moat here with little boats floating down a field with graham crackers and marshmallows

Its been a childhood dream of mine

And get the best chocolatier we want to impress

Im inviting every asshole from the Valley to attend

Youre inviting assholes

Absolutely

Assholes shit dongles any foe or enemy Ive made over my storied career will be here

That way when I take this stage and unleash the power of Bachmanity theyll all be in the front row

Erlich uh can we talk for a second

What is it Big Head I thought I told you to go watch something on your iPad

I think we may have a problem

That CodeRag reporter I talked to says that Gavin Belson is threatening to sue her if she doesnt tell him who she spoke to

So

So she spoke to me

No publicity is bad publicity This might be great timing

Exactly the reason that we are partners

Okay yeah Except if Gavin finds out it was me that talked to the reporter then hell know I violated my NDA

And then he could come after my entire settlement if that happens

All two million I mean 20 million

Big Head Im not going to yell

And Im not going to hit you

Im just gonna ask you nicely why in the holy fuck didnt you tell me you signed an NDA you sweet helpless little piece of shit

Well thats the thing about the NDA is that the NDA is actually covered under the NDA

So if I told you about the NDA it wouldve been a violation of the NDA

And what about speaking with the reporter What would that be

Yeah Shit

So what do you think I should do

I could call her back and

No

Let me handle it You go wait in the helicopter

Go

Okay

Sasha Im going to need to go back to the mainland

Oh is there a problem

Oh no no Full steam ahead

Mainland

This is an island

Thats the theme

Hawaiian

Well have a luau

Yeah somebody called me that in high school and the nickname just stuck

Pakistani Denzel

I mean I dont see it

But everybody else does So

Maybe they should call him American Dinesh 

BOTH LAUGH

Stop

Only if you stop first

No you stop first

You stop first

You go first

No I think you should

Okay Ill stop Bye

Whats your end game here You think after your tired rap shes going to hop on a plane fly halfway across the world and fuck you

My motivations are pure

Her and I have like a real connection

Shes so like nice and shes so down to earth that its like she has no idea how attractive she is

You dont know how attractive she is

Packet loss over Estonian broadband is terrible She could be hideous

Well I cant imagine that would matter to Dinesh one iota

Right Cause shes nice and uh very talented and has a great laugh

And with any luck shes not a dogface

How was your date with Winnie

Uh well pretty good considering shes still in the other room

Baller you got lucky on the first date

Yeah did a little bit uh not everything

I mean I slept in my jeans

Well take your time Hunger is the best sauce

Youre right Uh we did a little bit of under the shirts and like finger banging Oh hey

Hey Im Winnie

Oh

Hi Im Dinesh

Hi Im Jared

It is an honor to meet you

Okay

God what a pleasure

Thanks

Im Gilfoyle Are you a bartender

I work at Facebook

As a bartender

I had a stuffed animal named Winnie

Winnie Oh wow

I mean it wasnt technically an animal I took a Ziploc bag and I stuffed it with old newspaper and then I I drew a smile on it

Okay well uh shall we have some coffee my lady

Sure Lets do it

Okay All right

Were already on to Elizabethan nicknames This is serious

Theyll be Ren Faireing soon

Jared Its healthy

And now that Richards dating uh in solidarity I think I might get back out there myself

You make it sound like youve chosen not to date

Yeah absolutely I wanted to focus on Pied Piper

But yeah maybe now Ill fan out my plumage so to speak and see what pretty birdies might share my nest

Hey Jared If you fuck any pretty birdies in my server room put a tie on the doorknob wont you

Oh as a signal Yeah good thinking

Okay so Ill just get the car keys and then give you a lift home Okay my lady

My lord Oh My lady

BOTH CHUCKLE

Okay

So Richard tells me you guys are building deep nets into your platform

Oh really What other company secrets did he blab to you

Well Im a bartender I wouldnt understand all the sciencey talk right

Touch√©

So you do AI at Facebook

No but when I was at MIT I did my masters thesis on game playing AIs

I did a lot of machine learning stuff

For gaming How does that work

Its on my GitHub Do you want to check it out

Gavin said he was gonna haul me into court and have a judge compel me to give up my source or go to jail

Okay I am not going to jail

No no ones going to jail CJ

Although if you did going to jail for protecting your source would make you some kind of First Amendment hero

Its pretty much the best thing that can happen to a journalist

Journalist Okay Im a tech blogger

Okay I write stories for the internet about the internet

I am not going to jail for that

I know it is an inconsequential shit job

It doesnt really contribute to culture in any way whatsoever

Weve established that you dont have any journalistic integrity but what would it cost to buy you some

Winnie Then I figured out a way to train a convolutional net to play Atari 2600 games




    push

Uhoh

What

Spaces Yeah so what you guys use tabs

In this house yes

Richard is a bit of a zealot in the Tabs V Spaces holy war

I get that for his company Sure

This goes much deeper

I think he believes that people who use spaces are less than

Huh

I wouldnt mention this to Richard

You dont want to see him throw a hissy fit

Okay Shall we away my lady

Nice to meet you guys

Have fun

Bye

Gilfoyle Bye

I actually kind of liked her

Too bad Richards going to fuck it up

So you moved the swimming pool

Yeah it just felt like it was way too far from the house like crazy far

So I had this company come and just move it closer

Uhhuh But then you moved it back

Yeah turns out the guy who built this place knew exactly what he was doing and the pool was right where it needed to be the whole time

But now I know that for sure which feels good

Nelson do you like being wealthy

Yeah Oh man its awesome

So you want to stay wealthy

Okay yeah sure

Great

Here are the three things you need to do all right

One stop moving the swimming pool

Oh yeah okay I can do that What else

Two you need to manage your expenses and track your receipts a little bit better than this

Im only as good as the information I have

Oh youre great

No I wasnt fishing for compliments

And three I sense that people are taking advantage of you

PHONE VIBRATES

Oh Sorry hold on

Oh its Erlich I should probably grab this

Erlich Bachman a perfect example

You gave him signing power on your personal checking account

Yeah hes my business partner

Youre not structured as a corporation Youre a general partnership

So hes essentially your spouse

Thats very dangerous

But I trust him

Hes actually trying to save us money right now so hold hold on

Hey man

Big Head wondrous news

I eliminated the Gavin problem and at the exact same time I closed funding on our first strategic investment

We bought a blog

Oh cool How much do blogs cost

What

Oh nothing

We practically stole it from them

What

WHISPERS Im bullshitting

Half a million dollars

Let me talk to him please

Uh hey Erlich could you talk to uh my business manager for a second

No Ive got to jet but tell him Ill see him at the party

Good day partner

Okay cool

About the blog

500 grand

Oh God

I know we practically stole it right

Winnie Your roommates are really funny I like them

They gave me a little shit

Oh well you cant take that personally

Oh its fine They gave you shit too

Oh really What about like my hair or something

No They tried to convince me you were some sort of formatting nzi about tabs versus spaces

What Me nzi CHUCKLES

htler ACCENT Thats ridiculous

Thats what I said I mean I use spaces So what

Mm Yeah so what

See they said youd have a hissy fit if you found out

Mmmm Hissy fit me No

I know

You know I know

I mean make up your mind guys am I a nzi or am I a guy who throws hissy fits

You know Am I a nzi who throws hissy fits

I hope not That was htler That was like his whole deal

I mean thats pretty insensitive to the Holocaust dont you think

Cause thats like what htler did you know he just like klled so many people so tragic such a tragic time

Yeah

Im so glad were not doing that anymore

I mean we like I like I was you know whoa

I want them all to die I dont I dont care

I mean I do care dont dont kll them them Jews

Uh anyway what do you want to what do you want to order here

Is that our PtoP protocol

Yeah Im just hacking for fun

I figured out a way to use our compression for RTC so

Video chat Yeah I think it could be better resolution than HooliChat Even over 3G

It could just be like a fun cool feature in the platform you know

And then coincidentally youll finally be able to see what Elisabet actually looks like

Oh yeah

Huh

I hadnt thought of that

If you worked half as hard on the platform as you do trying to ogle strange Slavic women maybe our shares would finally be worth something

Hey uh what the hell was that

Can you give us slightly more Richard

Why did you tell Winnie that I think people who use spaces over tabs are stupid

Because you do

No I dont

And if I did which I dont why would you say that behind my back to her

I mean things were just going so well until she

WOMAN CHUCKLES

That was completely lovely

Yeah it was really nice

Youre really something

Ill give you a call later okay

Okay cool yeah

Great sounds good Bye Jared

Bye

Jared

Yeah

Who was that

Oh that was Carol

So uh Jared did did you just have sx with her

What Im an adult and like the rest of you Im a sexual being

You fucked her in the garage

Well its the server room and my bedroom

What so you just meet a woman and then you have sx with her

How often does this happen

Well if youre asking me how many times Ive been in love the answer is two

But the rest I wont talk about Its untoward

Russ was right this guy fucks

Who was that gorgeous gazelle in the driveway

Well Ive said all I care to lets move on

She let Jared have sx with her

Jared nice Using that dick

Gents Id like to invite you to what promises to be the social event of the season

Bachmanity Insanity

Alcatraz

Dont worry it will be unrecognizable

Jared with regards to the you need a plus one

Oh no thank you I think its too early for that

Good idea Dont bring sand to the beach theres already pssy there

Richard I assume youll be taking your woman friend

You know what Yes She and I will be there together

Im going to make this work despite all your little attempts to sabotage my relationship

You can do anything you put your mind to Richard

Including turning Alcatraz into Hawaii LAUGHS

You okay

Yeah Yeah all good Great CHUCKLES

You know

What

My roommates going out of town tomorrow so if we want to come back here after Erlichs party

Oh Okay yeah Sure that sounds good to me

All right its a date

See you then CHUCKLES

SIGHS Richard whats wrong

Nothing Nothing literally its all good

Come on CHUCKLES

Oh my God

Im sorry

Your roommates were right you really hate spaces

No no no

I dont its not hate hates a strong word

Um truth be told I do have a slight preference for tabs

But thats only because Im al and because I prefer precision

Well not to pick a fight here but if you really care about precision wouldnt you use spaces

Nn

But whatever

Once it goes through the compiler its the same thing Right

Yeah Yeah technically yes

I guess I just I just dont understand why you anyone would use spaces over tabs

Like if its all the same why not just use tabs

Because it could look different on other peoples computers

Tabs create smaller file sizes all right

I run a compression company trust me Ive devoted my life to minimalizing file sizes

Its what I do I mean I do not get why anyone would use spaces over tabs

I mean why not just use Vim over Emacs CHUCKLES

I do use Vim over Emac

Oh God help us

Okay uh you know what

I just I dont think this is going to work Im so sorry

Uh I mean like what were going to bring kids into this world with that over their heads Thats not really fair to them dont you think

Kids We havent even slept together

And guess what its never going to happen now because there is no way Im going to be with someone who uses spaces over tabs

Richard

Wow Okay Goodbye

One tab saves you eight spaces

DOOR SLAMS

BANGING

Richard Oh

RICHARD MOANS

Oh my God

Richard what happened

I just tried to go down the stairs eight steps at a time

Boyfriend You never mentioned a boyfriend

Oh no Um

This is because hes now just husband

Um I keep forgetting to say this husband but it is very good to see you this way and we will talk more tomorrow

Yeah well talk

COMPUTER BEEPS

Either she froze time met and married the man of her dreams unfroze time and hopped back on to vid chat with you or youre the dogface

 I saw you in my dreams 
 We were walking hand in hand 
 On a white sandy beach 
 Of Hawaii 
 We were playing in the sun

 On a white sandy beach 
 Of Hawaii 
 The sound of the ocean 
 Rocks me all night long 
 Ahhh 
 Ahhhhhh 
 Of Hawaii
