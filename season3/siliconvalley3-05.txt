Richard Okay heres another one

TechCrunch says Laurie Bream spotted lunching at the Rosewood with yet another rising tech star Sam Herron Could this finally be the new CEO of Pied Piper

Maybe shes just fucking them all

Its been ten days You know what would be nice

If I found out what Laurie wanted to do with my company from her instead of the fucking Internet

Richard the accountants finally agreed to release our books

Okay

Hey Richard Is there anything we should be doing

I dont know Why are you asking me

Im not the CEO There is no CEO

Because apparently Jacks empty fucking chair is a better choice than I am

So maybe maybe ask the chair see what it thinks

Say what you will about the chair but at least it never told me to build a fucking box

True Compared to Richard its a lot sturdier

And it has a lot less of Barkers ass rubbed all over it

THEME MUSIC PLAYING



Are you serious

On top of Jacks ridiculous severance package we spent a thousand dollars on each one of your fucking monitors

We did Huh Thats very pricey

So what Raviga funded us for 5 million

Theres no way we burned through all that

Do you have any idea how these deals work That moneys tranched

Whats that

Well from the Old French for slice

Yeah try to keep up Dinesh

We get our money in stages

Right We get 2 million upfront to get us going to design and build the product but we dont get the next three million until we take a product to market

Richard And Jack was okay with hemorrhaging money because he thought we were launching the box and then getting the next three million in the next few weeks

But the platform will take way longer to launch than that

Yes So we are effectively a 250 million company who just took 5 million in funding and now were deadass broke

Our burn rate is astronomical and every day we sit in limbo like this

What if we dont

What if we dont sit in limbo

Like fuck limbo right

I mean right now lets lets fire all these fucking sales assholes and break the lease on this place and get the fuck out of here

Can we do that Theres no CEO here to approve any of that

Yeah Theres also no CEO here to tell me not to do it right

Thats right Youre the CTO

Technically youre the ranking officer

fucking A

Look when or if a new CEO comes to take over the company we will do what they say to the best of our abilities

But there is a very real possibility that there wont be a company for them to take over if we dont do something about it now

So no more surprise waffles

What

No more Chef Amy

No

And no more of these stupid offices okay

Were going to move back to the hostel

fuck

Richard Dinesh we need to cut every corner save every penny and plow it into engineers to build the platform Okay

Then we will be back on track

So Gilfoyle Dinesh pack up those goldplated monitors because we are selling them

Jared come on Lets do this

Hmm

Well that sucks

ROWDY CHATTERING

Jesus

CHEERING

Okay guys Can I have your attention please

Yeah next goal wins

No Uh not Now Sorry its got to be now

And so bring it in Dang uh Chef Amy Jan the Man Keith Northeast regional

And do you still have your shadow

Yo

Richard Hey there he is

Okay uh circle up

All right I have some news for you

Is this about the new CEO

ReCode is saying it could be Reid Hoffman

No I dont know anything about that

No no Theres no new CEO Theres no new employees of any kind

Theres actually Its more about you guys becoming former employees

MURMURING So look

Were heading in a different direction

And what that means is if I havent taken you aside and spoken to you privately about staying on that does mean that you are terminated immediately

So Dang Chef Amy Jan the Man all of Sales I am uh really sorry about all this

Are you sure that you can fire us like legally

Yeah Yes absolutely

Im CTO Im the highest ranking officer so yes answer

Youre youre still CTO Laurie hasnt fired you yet

No she has Why would she fire me

Well CodeRag said that your tech is mediocre and thats why no one will take the CEO job

What

Yeah

Thats why I assumed that youd been fired

Uh maybe shes waiting till Friday to fire him

Oh that makes sense

No it doesnt make sense Thats not whats happening okay

Im not getting fired Thats crazy

I havent read this article Okay maybe Im too busy making the tech awesome because its not mediocre

Its actually turns out its fucking revolutionary

So I guess thats the truth

And also Im not fired these guys arent fired you all are fired

Everyone from this wall is fired So enjoy being fired

 

Jesus This is a good apple

Where did you get this

Oh I have a fruit guy

Fantastic

Read me back what we have so far

Uh Bachman and Bighetti shall each include in this venture any and all portfolio companies The exception shall be for Pied Piper

Hey how how come Pied Piper is not a part of it

Cause you know I actually used to work there so maybe it should be

Big Head Pied Piper is no longer an incubating entity

It would be unfair to you and to me and to them for me to relinquish any of my shares in their company

And besides like you Im giving up everything else I have of value shares options cash liquid assets

Wait So all my assets

That seems like kind of a lot

It is a lot Big Head Were both giving up a lot

And were both gaining a lot also

And thats what every successful partnership is about

Committing fully blindly and without concern of the consequences like marriage

Right

Oh here Get this down

In the event of a tie vote any disagreement shall be settled with a toss of a coin of Mr Bachmans choosing

What the fuck are you doing in here

Cant you see were having a meeting

Go ahead Big Head read that back to me

Oh um In the event of a tie

JUICER GRINDING LOUDLY

The fucking juicers broken

This is he second one in two days

CJ Cantwell of CodeRag writes and I quote Having met this many candidates without closing one one cant help wonder why Pied Piper cant land a man Could the vaunted tech of founder Richard Hendricks whom I once called the next Mark Zuckerberg be turning Pied Piper from a unicorn into a donkey wearing a party hat

And

And shes slandering my tech

Its the one thing thats working around here

Look I think if I just talk to her I can get her to change it

No I do not want you to engage with a muckraker like CJ Cantwell simply to salve your male ego

My male ego has nothing to do with this Laurie

Look good coders wont want to work for a company they think has shitty tech

I need to get ahead of this now

And if I dont were done

Richard whether you appreciate this or not I do actually have a plan here

You can meet with everyone in Palo Alto to replace me as CEO

Im not going to tell you how to do your job

Okay but I need to do something about this now

Sheshe shes calling us the next Clinkle

Clinkle Laurie Clinkle

You you do know what happened to Clinkle right

Do you want us to be Clinkle Please just stop saying Clinkle

It jars the ear Fine

I will have my office set up an interview

But I want you to present yourself well Richard

Be showered groomed welldressed

And you will need to sit down with our head of PR beforehand to go over talking points

Why

Because you are in an emotional state and when you are emotional you become highly inarticulate

Well I dont say thats true

Okay Yes Fine Sure

Um

And thank you Laurie

 

Before you ask the answer is yes

I did blow all these hard drives clean

So

Gilfoyle You really are a moron

The only way to really blow the hard drives clean is to take a drill and punch a hole through it

All right calm down Snowden I zeroed them all out were fine

Welcome welcome Uh we have lost our lease so everything must go

The chairs are arranged in ascending order of lumbar support

So have a gander

Oh uh word to the wise the Haworths are like a spa day for the buttocks

Yeah and I have a fragile posterior

My aunt used to call me glasshole

So you can take it from me

Look at these fucking maggots

Crawling all over our garbage leaving their slime of mediocrity

I thought youd feel right at home in a marketplace haggling selling your monkey paws looking for Indiana Jones in a wicker basket

Okay Marion was in the wicker basket Indiana Jones was tipping them over you fucking idiot

Hi

Let me know if you have any questions

Well how about that I made my first sale

Ive organized a lot of estate sales so this is kind of my wheelhouse

What

I have a lot of elderly friends

Oh that is a fun item

Thats a hardware fan

 

Youve got the yellow hoodie on today

Oh yeah

Wait a second

None of these are signed

Oh yeah Um its just my business manager had some questions about the way some of this stuff was being arranged

Like he said something about how its not a corporation

Its just a general partnership or something

I mean he told me I didnt understand which is true so he wanted to maybe talk to you about it

So you want to lawyer up huh Is that what were doing

I dont think he has a law degree

Big Head I would hope that a handshake deal would be good enough for you

Because were headed down a long road and that road must be paved with trust Blind trust

And you bringing in these socalled experts

PHONE RINGING

really gives me pause and it insults my honor

Huh Uh sorry hold on I got to take this Ill be right back

Sorry Hello

Hey Uh how do I look

If Im being honest like a ventriloquist dummy

Uh Okay

Well you know thats actually kind of fitting because Im on my way to Raviga right now to meet with a PR person to tell me exactly what to say to a reporter and how to say it

Well that does make sense

You do tend to babble on when youre under pressure

Why does this thing people say

Why indeed

That was weird

I just got a call from Laurie Breams office at Raviga asking if Id want to interview for the job of CEO at Pied Piper

What Are you fucking kidding me

Thats exactly what I said

Then I said no and then we both hung up

I mean I assume they hung up I had already hung up so

Wow SCOFFS Wow Okay

Okay Yeah great Big Head

Big Head fucking kidding me

What the fuck is going on

Big Head you can insult me all you want by involving your selfdescribed shylocks but to insult Richard and humiliate him thats like kicking a child whos done nothing to deserve it

I may not be able to finish my ramen

I told them no




    push

Hi there Richard Hendricks here to see Dawn Simon PR

Sure shell be meeting you in the small conference room Um do you need me

No no I uh I know where it is

It turns out I actually know something

Im not a fucking idiot

Richard Hendricks Hi

Before we get any further I just want you to know that um Im not going to be yelling at you but I probably am going to yell

Okay

Okay Uh because this is bullshit

Honestly I mean I get it This is your job Youre in PR

Your job is to pretty much tell me what I cant say

I mean when I talk to this reporter I probably cant say how fucked up it is that um Laurie Bream fired me and then replaced me with Action Jack Barker

I probably cant say how the only action he took was to essentially pick the wrong product and then bleed the company dry

And I probably cant say how fucking pissed off I am that Laurie Bream is out there gallivanting around the Valley interviewing every dickhole on Earth for my job including Big Head a man that I fired by the way and no offense I like him

I do actually hes a close friend of mine been that way for years

He is a bit of a simpleton his names fucking Big Head

But okay look

I want to be CEO of Pied Piper okay

It is my company I worked my ass off to build this company okay

Thats my job I deserve it

And it fucking kills me that Laurie is out there trying to give it to someone else anyone but me

But I probably cant say that can I

You can say anything you want to say to me

SCOFFS All right

Thank you for meeting me Monica

You are from

Baltimore

HL Mencken hails from Baltimore

Who

Widely perceived as a racist but his work on the English language is comprehensive and his perspicuous skewering of evangelicals is laudable

Monica my mission here is not merely to have fun

Thats thats okay

When I voted against you at the board meeting I just want

Monica this is not about you for once

I brought you here to say

I am sorry

For

Ah yes of course You are going to make me say it

Why am I not surprised

I made a mistake with Richard Hendricks

And out I went right on my ass

And then Laurie put that jackhole Barker in to bankrupt the company

But does she cop to that No no no

Because the Laurietron 6000 isnt programmed to admit when shes made a mistake

I made an error

Wow um thats really big of you to admit

I should not have removed him as CEO and installing Jack Barker in his place only compounded that error

But if thats true then why are you meeting with so many other CEO candidates

I am meeting publically with a number of highvalue candidates I know to be unavailable as well as with a number of lessqualified candidates with whom Richard compares favorably

Thats why you called Big Head

Yes You see Richard must not be perceived as being the most expedient candidate

He must be seen as the correct candidate

This is very exciting for Richard

I have been impressed by his conduct in a tough situation

Mmhmm

Hes shown mettle

Definitely

Therefore I will call for a vote at the next board meeting to offer him the job

That is of course assuming he continues to demonstrate an air of professionalism

Hi Dawn Are you waiting for someone

Yes Im supposed to be meeting with Richard Hendricks before he sits down with a CodeRag reporter

Oh thats weird I saw him earlier

And that is why

Im just being honest here

I think that Peter Gregory is better off where he is

Just saying because if he knew what Laurie was doing to his company he probably would want to take a gn and blow his brains out

Uh okay

We should probably start talking about the things that I can say

Um CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY

Richard Richard Hendricks

Yes Who are you

Dawn Simon Ravigas publicity director

So that would make you

CJ Cantwell CodeRag

BEEPS

Thank you I think I have everything I need

Please tell me that went well

Yep No yeah It uh itit was gone great

Yep It had gone

It was great

Uh shes a shes a great guy

Really Gir girl Shes shes cool Shes a cool one

Cool Um so I can just I can get out here

Just cause I got another thing

Dawn Yeah

Slow down Listen to me Look in my defense I said those were all the things I cant say okay

So its kind of like I didnt even say them

But you did say them at a meeting you scheduled with a reporter

Reporter Come on youre a tech blogger

Oh really Hard to see why Laurie insisted on a PR rep for you

Look uh just tell me what I can do to kll this

You want me to spike the story

Yes please

Give me something better I dont know go on a drunken racist Twitter rant or uh get in your car run over Elon Musk and give me an exclusive from jail Yeah

Otherwise Im posting this at noon tomorrow so

No no no no Look Look

If you want to leave youre going to have to run me over

SIGHS

These offices were nice

Now everything looks so bare

Yeah There is a certain sad vulnerability to it

Have you ever seen a naked dead person

No No No

Well the good news is we cleared almost

70000 from selling all this stuff

Thats not enough to afford all the coders we need

We need at least a dozen

Where would we even put them now

Shall we

Wait Wheres my hard drive

What did it look like

It just looked like a normal standard hard drive

You sure it was in your bag

Yeah it was in my bag

Could it maybe have slid out and was next to your bag which was next to all the hard drives we got rid of

Did you sell my personal hard drive

You didnt happen to wipe that one clean too did you

My personal hard drive

Yeah

No

fuck

So it had our confidential IP on it

Yes All the work we did on the platform the box everything

Well whats gone is not necessarily lost

Okay we just need to find it

I found my retainer in the school dumpster

I found my biological father in a militia up in the Ozarks

This should be no problem

Dont worry Dinesh well find it

Uh does he not know were moving out

Should we tell him

No Jack paid him in full up front and he seems so at peace

All right All right

 

I am such an idiot

Youve got no choice Richard

You need to go in to Laurie and just tell her what happened

What Its bad enough shes going to find out what I said after this piece posts online

You want me to go in and tell her right to her face

No fucking way

You could spin it Tell her youre sorry

I had it I had my old CEO job back and I fucked it up

KNOCKING ON DOOR

Ill get it

Ah The Super Angel Premium Deluxe

In the flesh

Yeah I had to drive to San Mateo to get one that has autoreverse

Why didnt you send your assistant

She was on the phone so

Well Big Head it takes a brave man to admit his mistakes and with this token of apology youve officially righted your wrong

Consider the matter resolved

Cool

Traditionally the offender shakes the offendees hand so you would come to me

Thats an honest Thomas

Gentlemen Monica from the ashes of whatever happens here will rise the Phoenix that shall be known as Bachmanity

Thats what youre going to call your company

Yeah well before it was going to be Bachman Capital

Because I provide the Bachman and he provides the capital

Yeah but then we compromised and made it Bachmanity cause its Bachman from him and then the Etti from me So its two syllables each

Very much into keeping score this one Have a seat

Ill go fetch the documents and my Montblanc

Psst

So slight hiccup I tracked down the woman who bought the drive but she wasnt interested in selling it back

Apparently shes already given it to her elderly father and booked the Geek Squad to set it up for him this afternoon

WHISPERING What about my drive All our stuff is on there

I think were fine She said he mostly uses the computer to download photos of old ships

I dont think hell be able to find our files even if he wanted to

Well I mean hopefully But still

Dinesh is right this is sloppy

Where does this guy live

Oh shit Richard Im sorry man

Initial here and here

No Its okay I I deserve it Its my own fault

And youre going to want to sign here

Still man that just really sucks

PHONE CAMERA CLICKING

You know I bet I bet you wish you could just scrub the whole Internet like Gavin Belson does right

Whoa weird Every single one of my signatures looks totally different

Wait What

Yeah look

This ones in cursive this ones just printed and then I one I just wrote Big Head but thats not going to hold up

No no no Did you just say Gavin Belson scrubbed the Internet

Oh yeah

Yeah and then they told me to my face that after Nucleus was shut down Gavin had one of his execs order them to scrub all negative mentions of Nucleus off of Hooli Search

Wow

Okay when exactly did this happen

No no Actually uh you told me that you would spike my story if I give you something better

This is better right

Yeah Lightyears better actually Your storys spiked

Great okay

As long as were trading apples for comparable apples Ive got a fresh and juicy thats ripe for the picking

Ms Cantwell what say you to an exclusive on the launch of a future financial behemoth

How about we just stick with Gavin

Gavin for Richard Deal

Done

Monica do you really need to be here

KNOCKING ON DOOR

Enough with the maritime metaphors

This is honestly like the best birthday gift that I ever couldve asked for

The CPS worker couldnt find my birth certificate but maybe now it is

And in other good news weve managed to fill out our engineering team

All right guys who wants to start work on the fragment uploader

Uh Gleb why dont you and Sanjay take it

Richard say hi

Yes uh hello I am uh Richard Hendricks the CEO of Pied Piper Welcome aboard

Engineers Hello

What the fuck is going on here

We got a little creative

Uh I read that the woman who started Peggd built her entire app using a team of coders from India she never met in person

And it only cost 15000

So yeah so we figured why limit ourselves to a few expensive people in the Valley when we could afford a full complement if we outsourced

Uh Richard I know we said that we sold everything in the offices to pay for these guys but that was not exactly true

Um we kept one thing

Okay

Richard Oh wow Its the CEO chair

Ah

Have a seat

Okay

Okay uh

Well uh why dont we uh go around the room or screens or whatever and uh introduce ourselves

Hello my name is Gleb I am in Bulgaria
