Well Richard according to all of your test results you are what we in the medical field call healthy

In fact youve got kind of a glow about you

Oh really

Absolutely

You know if it were medically possible I might even think that you were pregnant

Of course I thought my girlfriend was pregnant and I was sure wrong about that Laughs

Whoops Hey give me that ring back

Oh what a mess

What a mess that was

So been any big changes for you diet or exercise

Well I actually got fired as CEO of my company

Im working now as the CTO under the new CEO Jack Barker

Wait a minute You got a boss at your own company

Yeah I know that sounds bad but honestly he handles all the budgeting all the VC funding

He just negotiated a great new lease on our new offices

I dont know I think this could be great for me

Boy I dont think I could have another doctor coming in here being my boss

No Itd be like Hey boss is it okay if I listen to his heart Can I do that Oh no Sorry No I wont Okay laughing Whatever you say

chuckles

Ah funny

It is funny Yeah

But listen if it works for you thats great

Just one more thing

Ive gotta check your testicles

Oh my God Okay

What for like a hernia or something

No I just wanna make sure theyre still there

laughs

theme music playing

 

Oh wow This is going to be our office

All of this

Yeah Jack said we have the whole floor

Dinesh Wow look at that kitchen This is great

Richard is that our new logo

I like it Its clean and elegant but not without some danger

Jack Gentlemen welcome

I moved away from the fluteplaying guy

I dont know if you guys realized it but that was a little phallic

I didnt want to waste your time with it so I just pulled the trigger

Mari Sheibley did this

Oh Mari Sheibley

That mustve set you back a bit

No Shes a friend

Yeah I know her as well

Casually

So why dont I show you guys your new home

Hopefully it lives up to your standards

Gilfoyle Yeah compared to the shit shack were used to anythings an improvement

Ah an insult born of respect

Ill worry when we start complimenting each other

fucking dick

I assume you saw Hiroki putting in the water feature

Good feng shui Gotta have that

This is the engineering area

Dinesh Were gonna work here

That is a separate professionallycatered microkitchen back there

I want you hungry here never here

This is all great but can we really afford all this

Hey step into my office Richard

Here

Okay

I wanna show you something

Dinesh This is way better than Erlichs shthole

Richard The Conjoined Triangles of Success

I invented that and now its taught at business schools

You see whats on the bottom here

The foundation of the whole thing

Growth

Growth

The more brilliant people we can get working here then the faster we can get whatever is in your head out into the world

Let me tell you a story

In 1999 Google was a little startup just like we are

And when they started bringing in chefs and masseuses we thought Theyre nuts

But they were attracting the best possible people and they were able to create the best product and now theyre worth over 400 billion

And do you know the name of that company

Google right You said it at the beginning of the story

Youre right I did that wrong

And the whole point is that all of this is a sound investment as long as we are able to get the best people and make the best possible product

 

All right Winner gets the big monitor

I understand how this works

Both Ready

Rock paper scissors shoot

Suck it

I shouldve known youd throw rock

Thats all you know in Pakistan Its in your blood

Dont you guys call it Rock Rock Rock

Thats funny You should type up all your racist jokes on your tiny monitor

Is that monitor not big enough

You need a bigger monitor

You just put it on the list over there and our purchasing guy will hook you up

Seriously

Absolutely

Hey Jared how about you You need any new gear for the office

No Im BYOC

Let me know if you need anything

Richard do you think itd be okay if I took this box

Im moving out of Noahs guest house after work

And you want to sleep in that box

laughs No

I havent slept in a box in years Stop

Now that Pied Pipers funded I have enough money to move back into my condo

Oh Congratulations

I thought you sold it

No Ive been AirBNBing it out to cover the mortgage

But itll be good to get home

Ive been missing my tub a lot and Noahs been using a lot of hate speech with me lately so moving will be a good thing

All right guys think Im gonna take off unless you need me to stick around help you transition

I

By doing what

I could introduce you to some of the people that work here

I made some major inroads with Hiroki

No

Why would we want that

Fair yeah fair point

So welcome to your new home

Enjoy it guys I gave you this

 

Oh

Sorry Sorry

 

How was everyones morning

Uh yeah

Mmhmm

Let me tell you about mine

I started my day as I always do by typing my own name into HooliSearch

I enjoy the ritual which is designed to center me

But lately its been doing the opposite

Whose work station is this

Observe

keyboard clicks

These are all remnants of a time before I wrote Nucleus down

Why are we allowing our own technology to dredge up our painful past

Why is it that when I type my own name into my own company search engine the fucking Internet rains shitbolts down on me

I want this to stop

These articles are part of the public record

Your point

Are you suggesting that we alter the fundamental neutrality of the HooliSearch algorithm

Thats a clear violation of the public trust

Yelp is threatening to sue Google for this very thing

I cant in good conscience order HooliSearch engineers to do that

I never suggested anything of the sort

No HooliSearch engineer will ever be asked to alter the neutrality of the algorithm

 

Patrice And so Gavin doesnt want to see any more negative mentions of Nucleus on HooliSearch

So were gonna alter the search algorithm

Of course not That would be unethical

What are we supposed to do

Promote other websites to outrank the bad Nucleus news

Do you have any idea how big a fucking job that is

Dont you swear at me

We dont work here anymore

For 10 more days you do

Unless youd all like to quit and walk away from your entire severance packages

Amazing

whistling

Whoa whoa Oh

Jared Whoa

laughs

Whats up

Hi Umm

Im sorry Im a little confused

You you were supposed to be out on Tuesday

Oh I was but plans have changed

See

I cant really afford to move or pay rent so Im gonna have to stay a little while

Okay look

I appreciate your situation but youre breaking the terms of our contract

Listen I dont want to be a dick its just I cant afford to live around here

cause the rent is so high because of the tech companies right

And you bought this place with the money you made working at the tech companies so it kind of all evens out right

That that makes no sense

I know Right

Okay look I can give you a few days two weeks tops but if youre not out by then Im gonna have to take legal action

This bums me out man

I thought you were like the one cool tech guy

Me

Are you sure

Not anymore

 

Well

Well the occupant of a residence in California has almost unlimited rights

I have to get his permission to enter my property

I cant turn off the power or the gas and I have to hire a lawyer to start a legal eviction That wont be cheap

Jeez man Im sorry That sucks

So where did you sleep last night

I did not How was your sleep

It was it was good yeah

I mean I slept like a stone

Its odd not having to do everything ourselves isnt it

Yeah Im Im kinda loving it

Hey you ready to go to work

Chef Amy asked us what we wanted for breakfast and I said Surprise us

Could be anything Lets go

When was the last time you saw those two go anywhere before noon

Indeed

Well lets go get some glutenfree waffles

Oh Sorry about the surprise

I dont care

I asked Chef Amy to tell me

I have too many dietary restrictions to leave breakfast to chance

Makes sense

Ah two of my incubees off to eat the world

Be well work hard and know one another

chuckles

Okay

I recently helped them install a new CEO at Pied Piper

I needed to take a more handsoff approach focus on the future incubees like yourself with great ideas like cataloging malware

Sexy Uh would you care for another coconut water

They are the most expensive unpasteurized variety if thats any concern

Actually my concern is the room

Its kind of a dump

Oh sure now

But with a new coat of paint youll hardly recognize the place when you move in next month

Actually shits pivoted

I need a place next week

Next week Oh shit has pivoted

Well Ill talk to the current tenant

Let him know that the time has come

Mother fuck

Yeah put him on a slow boat to China so to speak

Im sorry It just slipped out

Ill ask Chef Amy to make you something else

No no no I want waffles

people murmuring

I just wanted them to be a surprise Jared

I wanted surprise waffles

Gilfoyle Who are these people

Uh I dont know

Did Jack hire engineers already

These people are not in the engineering gene pool

Thats right fellas

These are our new sales people

Theyre the best in the business

Sales Uh Jack

Jack

Shouldnt we hire engineers to build the platform before we get people to sell it

No

God no

The system Richard

Sales and engineering are the two pillars of the Conjoined Triangles of Success

Yeah

Engineering and sales must work together to decide what to build

Who knows better what the customers need than the people who actually deal with the customers every single day

Were all gonna meet at 100 Richard

Youre gonna love these guys Theyre the best

 

So while the Hooli lawsuit did hamper our ability to get funding it did not slow down the engineering

Yes question

Yeah Keith Northeast Regional

So you dont foresee any technical debt issues slowing our ability to scale

Actually no none whatsoever

Weve identified all our underlying issues and we have a plan in place for rapid growth

Uh yes

Don Global Accounts and Systems Integration

What kind of growth are you projecting here

Well this may sound a little bit grandiose but its not unrealistic to think that we have the potential for worldwide penetration on the scale of say Google or Facebook

This is really great Richard Just keep going

Sure Yeah

Well in regards to the launch we are hoping to go wide get it into the hands of as many people as possible

Jan Director Inside Sales

They call me Jan the Man

Oh

When you say people you mean companies right

Yeah were businessfacing

Okay just wanted to clarify

Actually no No sorry Jan the Man

By people I do mean people

Humans Consumers

Uh Keith Northeast Regional again

Jack told us we would be selling directly to businesses

He did

Doug Im shadowing Keith

Yes he did

Definitely I was there

Don again

Well Im sorry for the misunderstanding because the plan has always been entirely based on the freemium model like Dropbox

You know you give the platform away free to consumers and then once you have a big enough user base then you sell premium services to businesses

If were giving it away now and waiting until later to sell it what are we doing here now

I dont know I dont know

We could maybe ask Jack when he gets back from wherever




    push

Sorry one second Just just one moment

Jack Sorry Jack

Sorry Excuse me Jack

Are you leaving

Oh I have this charity wine thing

Sorry I committed to it months ago but you are killing it in there Richard

Uh well actually no

Sorry They just said that you told them that we would be businessfacing

Ah they filled you in Thats good

I was under the impression that we would be consumer first

My guys are pretty set on that

Richard I read your deck and you projected itll be four years until we get to revenue

Uh yeah

You know were in a bubble right now right

Or maybe you dont know You werent around for the last bubble

You were probably in diapers

I was 11

Well I wasnt in diapers

I dont I wasnt either

I was there

And in March of 2000 do you know when a fouryear plan ended

April of 2000

We gotta move now

We cant put all of our eggs in the potofgoldattheend oftherainbow basket

So the the pot of gold is in the basket

Richard these are the best salespeople in the world and when they tell me that businessfacing is the play I gotta listen to that okay

Thats fair but its

Im just asking you to talk to your guys about modifying your platform for enterprise

I mean just just see how it feels okay

And no matter what happens I promise you this I will never compromise the product

Okay Okay

Fine I will talk to my guys but theyre not gonna be happy about it

No of course not Theyre engineers

Ill see you later

I realize this is a Japanese tradition and that you are Chinese

Im not racist

Yes Japanese people racist

They are horrible

No No no

JianYang in every relationship there are ebbs and flows

Ebbs

Yes

And although we have flowed our relationship now has come to a permanent ebbing

Flow

No

No

We have come to a permanent ebb

Do you understand

So you want me to leave the house

Yes Yes Very much so

And so I thank you for our today

Now you bow

Bow

All the way to the waist

Nno

Okay

Thank you Elrich

Goodbye little one

Im gonna miss you

Cant say it wasnt fun JianYang you little Cantonese bstrd

garbage disposal grinding

Hey you like this

What are you doing

Hi my names Erlich Bachman

Im a lying fuck

Who who are you yelling at

Were the only two people in the fucking house

Erlich a liar

Youre not gonna get me to change my opinion about myself

Liar Take that outta there

I dont know Richard I dont think its that big a deal

Really you dont Youre okay with being business first

Granted its not what we would do if we were in charge but Jack seems to know what hes doing

This is fucking amazing

I feel like Im in Minority Report

And in reality youre just a minority

Richard relax Were still building the neural net

We still get to do all the cool stuff right

Yeah of course

Were not scrapping any peertopeer delivery

No no definitely not

So were still doing the same stuff just in a different order

Yeah I guess youre right

Well the eviction process is officially underway but my attorney says it may take up to a year

Where are you gonna stay

Well I always have my trick

All right Ill bite Whats your trick

I simply imagine that my skeleton is me and my body is my house and that way Im always home

Okay Well we are now businessfacing I dont know if you heard

That means we have to rewrite our entire deck

I just hope it doesnt put us way the fuck behind

Behind who EndFrame sucks and Nucleus shit the bed remember

Yeah yeah Youre right youre right

chimes

Wow

 

sighs This is endless

If we worked this hard on Nucleus in the first place we probably wouldnt be scrubbing it right now

Dude are you done

Yup

Howd you script digest all those strings so fast

I dont know Its just a predictive loop

Actually its sort of like a context tree

 

Holy shit

Whats up

Hey Jared why dont we knock off for tonight

Just pick this back up tomorrow morning

Mmm Agreed

Im going on close to 40 hours without good sleep and the edges of things are starting to get a little dancey

What

Erlich thank you again for allowing me to occupy a corner of your cozy garage

It is my hearth and my home

What the fuck

yells

JianYang Jesus Christ dont sneak up on people like that you devious little bstrd especially if theyre cleaning glassware

You kick me out but you let him stay

Hes not even an incubee

No hes not and hes not staying in the house

Hes in the garage like a sad bag of potting soil

Have some compassion

I mean the guy rented his place to some fuckhead tenant who wont leave

Jared is fucked JianYang

He can go to the police

Its useless California law gives landlords literally no recourse

So he can go to court

Of course hes going to go to court you foureyed turd

But in America the legal system doesnt work very well so it will take at least a year for the proceedings to even begin

Do you understand that

Yes I stay here for one year

I pay no rent

You have no recourse

Thats not always the case I mean sometimes court systems can move faster especially if you have money for

Im going to smoke in my room

Oh Mother fuck

Special occasion

If we stack that same loop on top of the bitlevel encoder that we took from Hendricks and then we tethered it to the routine we were trying to use

That would be a huge jump in speed

This is mega This is what Hendricks did at Tech Crunch Disrupt

I think we just cracked middleout

We should probably tell Gavin right

Why He fired us

You know how much we could get paid if we took this somewhere else

 

phone cameras clicking

fuck off

Okay let me get this straight

First you talked me into going businessfacing and now you want to eliminate the entire neural net from the platform

Jan Director Inside Sales They call me Jan the Man

Yes we know Jan the Man

Listen we have to do neural net for deep learning

Look once we get enough data flowing through the system it will be able to recognize longrange patterns and actually learn

It will be able to optimize our algorithm on its own increasing our already superior speed and efficiency

Right Pretty cool huh

But it wont be able to do that if we delete it

Do you get that

But you just said it

It requires a central repository of data right

Businesses want to protect their data

Theyre huge pussies when it comes to security

Okay well were not cutting machine learning Were not

If we cut that we might as well cut peertopeer delivery and all the efficiencies of the cloud

Are those still in

No those have to go also

What

Keith by the way

I know your name okay I know everybodys name

Look chuckles we cant cut everything about this platform that makes it revolutionary just because thats a little harder for you guys to sell all right

If we want to sell out lets just sell all the way out

Lets just take the algorithm jam it into a metal fucking box stick it in the back of a data center somewhere so it cant connect to anything and it just sits there and no one even knows its there

Doug still shadowing Keith

When you say metal box youre talking about a rackmounted servertype appliance

No no no I am using it as a rhetorical example of a bad idea

Thats fucking stupid

Oh my God

I just need to find Jack One second

Wheres Jack

He had to go meet his vet

His vet In the middle of the day

Okay well whats the vets address

 

Jack excuse me Do you mind telling me

Holy shit What is that

Oh mother of God

Richard what are you doing here

What do you mean Its 230 What are you doing here

My number one breeding mare went into heat

Sorry shes not much for schedules

Oh God

Thoroughbreds Richard

Natural cover only

Now you dont see that very often do you

Nope Uh I had a meeting I had a meeting with the sales guys and Jan the Man

stammers

You know what Can we talk over here

This is just hard for me

horse grunting

Look Jack you and I have a problem

Okay your salespeople are telling me to cut everything cool about the platform just because its a little bit harder for them to sell

But dont you think because they are such amazing salespeople that it would be okay for them to sell the harder stuff

No It doesnt work that way

The way you keep the best salespeople is you need to give em something easy to sell

scoffs

Otherwise theyd just go somewhere else

Okay well Pied Piper could honestly be the global standard for file compression and storage

Every mobile device on the face of the planet could be able to access their data as if they had a fiber optic cable plugged into it

People in the desert people in refugee camps people who have nothing could suddenly have access to everything

You know everybody in this industry they say they want to make this world a better place but we could actually do it

We could do it and make billions of dollars

Richard listen

No you listen to me Jack

You promised me that you would never compromise the product

So do you feel like taking some action and backing me up on this because me and my product feel pretty fucking compromised right now

Richard I dont think you understand what the product is

The product isnt the platform and the product isnt your algorithm either

And its not even the software

Do you know what Pied Pipers product is Richard

Is

Is it me

Oh God No

No How could it possibly be you

You got fired

Pied Pipers product is its stock

Its stock

And whatever makes the value of that stock go up that is what we are going to make

And maybe sometime in the future we could change the world and perform miracles and all of that stuff and I hope we do

But like I told you before Im not going to mortgage the present for that

I need to move the needle today

And now if you will excuse me

I paid 150000 for the semen thats about to come out of that stallion and I would very much like to be there to see that it happens

cell phone chimes

horse neighing

Oh Hey Richard

Yes

I just got a text from Keith Northeast Regional

He says the guys love your idea

What idea

 

Announcer Its a big world but thanks to modern technology its smaller than ever

Today business moves at the speed of light

You can access your companys data anywhere anytime

But if you can get your data who else can get it

Spies thieves criminals and foreigners

What if there was a way to take all of your companys data and back it up in a protected enclosure completely isolated from the world at large

Oh no

The ultimate enterprise data storage solution

Now thats what Im talking about

This is the game were playing team so lets win it

You guys check it out

Chef Amy hollowed out a watermelon and filled it with watermelon jello

Look thats actual rind

The fuck is that
