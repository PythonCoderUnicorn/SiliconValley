Shit I I swear I deleted a picture but when I clicked back to the album the icon reappeared It undeleted itself

But I cant get it to happen again so

Hey Richard totally out of the blue do you know how we might be able to find that bug

No Dinesh We are not releasing the beta

We integrated the neural net a week ago The platform is full of bugs

But that is what a beta is for

You give it to people in the real world they use it and that is how we find the bugs

Richard Reid Hoffman says if youre not mortally embarrassed by the quality of your initial release youve released too late

Okay We already are mortally embarrassed

Okay We move in and subsequently out of our offices mainly because it was too expensive we fired two CEOs weve pivoted to a box and then pivoted back

Any more bad word of mouth and we will be royally fucked

Wheres Gilfoyle

Hey Gilfoyle the deletion issue is ducking me again and and um Im sorry

Oh hey Richard

Hi Tara

I need to borrow your fella here for a second

All right babe I gotta go

Hey when you check out the settings view can you let me know if theres something weird that happens with the submit button

It was a little weird when I was doing QA

Yeah okay

Sorry the the settings view for

The beta

The beta for

Pied Piper Its a promising compression company that doesnt pay very well

You sent her the beta

I did

Are you fucking insane Its not ready

Its riddled with bugs

Really Cause Ive been test driving it all day and its pretty fucking awesome

Really You think so

Yeah For real

Congratulations Richard Its so fucking cool

And when the neural net kicks in its gonna be rad

But you know I did have one problem though

I tried to restore an old file and it asked me to confirm twice

Yeah well that was a bad merge

Its been there for months I fixed it in ten seconds

Richard

Maybe

Yeah maybe beta

Hi Dinesh

Tara

THEME MUSIC PLAYS

Wait that cant be right How can Bachmanity still be so far in the hole

Look at all this shit that Big Head is selling

He was renting virtually everything in the house

He rented that cannon

It was for display purposes only So you forfeit your deposit

Its a cannon Whats he supposed to do not fire it

That was the provision

So thats it then I guess

Big Heads really broke

You know what Hes young Hell get past it

Nelson is not the only one who should be worried

You were partners

Fair point

But shuttering a company in the tech world is almost a rite of passage like herpes simplex one

At first its ugly and embarrassing and youre disgusted by your own dick

But after a while in the larger scheme of things you realize its really

Mr Bachmann you structured Bachmanity as a general partnership

Then with no money in the bank you threw a milliondollar luau on Alcatraz

Youre on the hook for that

And even declaring bankruptcy isnt going to absolve you of these debts

Bankruptcy

Its none of my business Good luck

Wait where are you going We need you Youre our business manager

Theres no business remaining to manage

Good day Mr Bachmann

Hey good news They said we can each keep one of the cannonballs so not a total loss right

All right so Ive set up a signup page for the beta and were gonna keep it small and secure so that means were limited to ten invite codes each to send out

Ive already got my list

Its people that I know personally and uh people that I know I can trust

Hm we only get ten each This could be prickly

Well Im out I dont trust anyone

Its a huge part of my belief system

You sent the beta to Tara

Yeah there was a transactional nature to that exchange which Ill get into if you want

Pass

But it doesnt mean that I trust her and I certainly dont trust anyone else

Oh in other words you have no friends

On principle I could make what rises to your low standards of a friend any time I want

Sure you could

Gilfoyle if youre not gonna use your ten invites could Dinesh and I have them

Sure Knock yourselves out

Loser Hes got no friends

Okay

Jared Miriam Sylvia

Oh Samantha CHUCKLES I almost forgot her

You know Jared you can have all ten of Gilfoyles invites

Much appreciated

Yeah

PHONE VIBRATES

Monica hello

Um did you honestly think that you could send me an email telling me that you were launching the beta without sending me the beta

Come on Im dying to see it

Well I think the whole point of it Monica is to get the beta into the hands of unbiased people so they can give us an honest feedback

Besides I I just gave out my ten invites

Oh if Monica wants an invite I could like squeeze her on my list

WHISPERS Are you sure

Yeah no problem

Okay Monica well youre in luck

Dinesh has decided to give you one of his codes so

Great I promise Ill find something terrible to say

Okay so I did a rough accounting of your assets and liabilities

Jared dont look at me like that Just give it to me straight

All right Your house has appreciated in value since you bought it but if you sold it now for what Zillow and Redfin think its worth

Id still be half a million in the hole

Now thats the bad news

Is there good news

Well its unclear

I I went back through your records

Uh at first Ill admit a bit voyeuristically uh to see where all of the money went and apart from the party expenses which were LAUGHS staggering

Yeah fuck yeah

But one number jumped out at me

Now whoever did your accounting earmarked almost 70 percent of Big Heads settlement money for taxes

Seventy percent

Even in TaxoAlto which I coined would be half that

Where did that money go

Well that is the sixmilliondollar question

I may have the answer

Im sorry Youre accusing me of impropriety

You the man who spent 20000 renting giant fiberglass tiki heads and 40000 more when one of them was misplaced on the way back to the rental house

I told you it wasnt misplaced I know exactly where it is

Its at the bottom of the bay

I called you a thief because you sir have stolen from us

Nelson come on You cant possibly believe this

Sorry

Dont apologize to him

Oh right Sorry

Thank you

Arthur you listen to me and you listen good

I have people calling me 40 times a day asking for their money

I even considered selling my house to pay them

So you are going to go in your little fucking piggy bank right now and pay back every fucking kopeck that you stole from Big Head and if you dont were gonna take our little show on the road perhaps perform it for a man named the DA

Ridiculous

Very well

Game on

Lets go Big Head

Wait

I may have moved around some of your money in a way that wasnt exactly conventional

Give me back Big Heads fucking money

Yeah

Sorry Sorry

No you did good

I cant because I dont have it

Hey Marc we may have a problem

Whats up

Well a buddy of mine at Datatrode sits next to a guy who just got invited to Pied Pipers beta

Shit Theyre already in beta

Should I tell Gavin

fuck no Were still two or three months out

Yeah if he hears Pied Pipers already in beta trust me hell lose his shit

Fine But if it ever comes up I didnt hear about this

Gavin And this came in when

Man 43 minutes ago

And deleted six minutes after that

Fortunately the filters which I had installed sir caught the relevant keywords

I decided to walk it to you personally

An employees withholding critical information about a competitor

This is a fireable offense

You want me to bring this guy in

No

Acting on this would expose the fact that were reading employees private emails destroying the spirit of trust and freedom to innovate that Ive worked so hard to build here at Hooli

You know it makes you wonder if the word Hooli has any meaning for these people whatsoever

Is there anything I can do

Yeah

Get me a look at that Pied Piper beta

I will figure out a way sir

Finally Where the fuck have you

Hey thanks for the lift Kevin

Yeah no worries

Oh Kevin this is Dinesh one of my coworkers

Dinesh this is Kevin We met at Phils Coffee

Hey

Were friends now Isnt that right Kevin

Yeah

All right my friend I should get to work so thanks for the lift

Yeah

Thanks for the coffees

Catch ya later my friend

That was my friend Kevin

Congratulations You now have one friend

He also said there was a bug on the landing page

Well how severe is it

Not bad

Compared to the rest of what he said its nothing

Guys uh you might as well hear this from me

Uh I just had a long talk about the beta with my friend Todd Chambers

The Dropbox guy

Yeah he was employee number 11

Why did you send it to him He hates everything

Well because I thought he would be honest with me and um and he was

Quite honest

Uh he said that in the 15 years hes been working in the Valley our beta was the best beta hes ever seen

By far

What Really

I dont want to count our chickens before they hatch

I mean three percent of hatchlings are born mutated or dead but we may have a healthy brood on our hands

Im getting the same reaction

I mean a few bugs here and there but overall they love it

We might be holding pocket aces here

Awesome

Hey guys

How you holding up

Richard Good yeah

I mean just trying to make sense of all the feedback

Well you know I guess you just cant let it get in your head

Dont you mean go to my head

What did I say

You said get in your head like its like its a bad thing but its not

Its great People love it

Really

Yeah Yeah I cant believe it myself

Theyre flipping out

Thats awesome That

And thats thats for the beta that you sent me

No Monica Its for the other beta that weve got kicking around here

CHUCKLES I mean I I I have an inbox full of raves here for the upload performance the mobile the

What about what about the interface

Did people have any issues with that

No not at all Why Do

Do you have any issues with the interface

I I havent actually had a chance to look at it yet

Are you serious Youve been sitting on the beta for a day after busting my balls about not getting an invite

Pretty fuckin lame

Yeah Sorry

Yeah Lame

I just got an email from my friend Max Karnow

He says I heard the betas awesome Can I get a look

Guys I think were starting to get some buzz

You know maybe we should talk to Laurie about moving up the official launch

You want to move it up

Yeah I think were ready

I mean do do you think you can set the meeting

Yeah

Yeah Ill Ill go tell Laurie right now

Okay




    push

What was that about

Shes fucking weird

Hey Richard um if your friend Max Karnow needs an invite you know I could probably squeeze him on my list

Are you sure

Yeah Ill have to freeze out one of my boys but theyll get it

Just shoot me his email

The perpetrator has been losing money for other clients for years was lying to us and funneling our money to said other clients therein fucking us

Im sorry to say this is not an uncommon occurrence

Wait its not an uncommon So then it

Okay got it

So if it makes any difference Id like to vie for a lesser sentence if after he makes full restitution he would write a very convincing public apology preferably

Mr Bachmann an action like this is very expensive and timeconsuming and as youve already pointed out even if you do prevail the money is gone unless you win a court order allowing you to raid other innocent peoples bank accounts and thats a tough sell even for a plaintiff whos more uh sympathetic

Are you calling us unsympathetic

You just threw a milliondollar party

A tasteful Polynesian affair culturally accurate which Im sure you would appreciate and one that we can no longer pay for because this criminal has left us flat broke

Also not true You have a large stake in a company called Pied Piper

Yes but I I cant sell my shares at Pied Piper Not now

Wouldnt it cover your outstanding debts

Of course But they could potentially be worth billions

Yes and how do you see that playing to people who are being priced out of their homes by rich tech people

Have either of you been on a jury

No of course not I always get out of it The fines are very reasonable

You dont just throw those things away

Gentlemen let me tell you what I see

I see two ablebodied entitled young white men who lucked into more money than most people see in five lifetimes and who if they hadnt had their millions stolen would have promptly squandered them on more things like relocated swimming pools and lost tiki heads

Its not lost

I know exactly where it is Its in the bay

And if your Coast Guard would be a little more helpful we probably could have dragged it out of there by now

Mr Bachmann you pay those caterers and bartenders you owe money to or I assure you that I will prosecute

Mr Chugtai I am gonna need all the phone numbers of the people on your list

Why

Im just calling everybody that was on the beta and saying hi and a quick thank you and then a just a couple of followup questions

Yeah I dont think so

What do what do you mean

Well I mean put yourself in their shoes

Theyre like snowboarding in Tahoe or like banging some smokin chick and then this fuckin nerd calls and he wants to talk about his app

Buzzkill

Wait Your boys are where

Well those are just hypotheticals

I mean my boys could be anywhere I dont keep track of my boys

Actually we can

We have the IP address and GPS coordinates for every active user so we can figure out just where your boys are at

Um you added a godview When did you do that

Right before I gave it to Tara I told you trust no one

Oh that is very cool Nice work Gilfoyle

And we can isolate each of our users

Dineshs for example

Before we invade peoples privacy there is a conversation about ethics

Why is it that five of your users show up at this address

Oh its buggy

Should we beta test the godview

Im happy to drag this out as long as you want to

Fine

I was having trouble filling up my list so I made up a few people

Well people do create imaginary friends to meet their emotional needs

When I was little I used to pretend that I shared a room with Harriet Tubman and we were always planning our big escape

Wait Who is this and why are they at the Hooli campus

What Did you give the beta to someone at fucking Hooli

Whos Max Karnow

Oh Thats not one of my friends

I have no friends Got him from Richard

No No th that cant be right

Man I went to Hendricks Facebook page

I found a friend of his that lived near Palo Alto searched his name and found that he was in the tech business

I then came up with a great idea to dummy up an email account in his name sent a beta request to Hendricks and then voila

Thats incredible

Yes well it is my craft

You see I think security detail is like creating great jazz where you can all

What are you talk Im talking about the beta Will you shut the fuck up

Ahem

fuck this is good

Their signup flow their mobile app its just seamless

How are they doing this

I can put a team on that sir

If you want to know how they

Why are you so highmaintenance

Do you want me to answer that sir

No gddmn it

Youre so needy

Okay I just talked to the real Max Karnow and he had no idea about the beta

Wow um clearly were dealing with a Hooli spy here

So what do we do

I mean shut down his account obviously

Yeah On it Sorry Dinesh

You will now have one less fake friend

Wait Gilfoyle Is shutting down this guys account really the worst thing we can think of to do to him

Oh my God Where the fuck is my head

Stand by

Look at their compression ratios

The more files uploaded the better they get

Are we doing that

No Not really

Thats gotta be some kind of machine learning optimization

Maybe a neural net Well then I want that

You need to put that into our platform Now

Im not even sure we have the resources here to engineer something like that

And even if we did our platform isnt designed to accommodate it

Youre talking about a groundup rebuild

Great So do that And beat them to market

Thats impossible

Youre at Hooli now Marc

In case you didnt know here at Hooli we make the impossible possible

So if I say I need

COMPUTER PINGS

What the fuck is happening

Marc Oh shit

It looks like a zip bmb They must know its us

That hard drive is fucked

This is my personal laptop

You opened a stolen beta on your personal computer

Yes And I installed it on my phone

Shit It could fry the entire system

Cut the power to the building No Gavin

Its isolated to your user account so its just your laptop and your phone

It has no impact on the rest of the network

You dont know that You dont know shit None of you do

You dont even know what Hendricks is capable of

Cut the power to the building Cut the power to the building

Gilfoyle And thats that

And now delete user

Richard Nice

Wait is that is that Monica She finally opened it

Oh yeah Well thats odd

It says here that she started using it yesterday

Wait so she lied Why would she lie about using the beta

Yeah why would Dinesh lie about having friends

Why would Tara lie to me about fucking other guys when we have a totally open and hedonistic relationship that allows for behavior like that

Because people like to lie Richard

Its a war of all against all

The history of humanity is a book written in blood

Were all just animals in a pit

I feel very sad

fucking Gilfoyle

No no What are you doing Get back to work

On what You powered down all the computers

Use a notepad Code on your phone We have a deadline here

No Gavin you have a deadline

We quit like we should have done the first time

What first time What are you talking about

We both worked at Nucleus right here in this room

Yeah before you fired us and rehired us to do the exact same thing without ever noticing

I invited you to my wedding Gavin

Why

We just lost our key engineers

What the hell do we do now

No one leaves this room until we figure it out

Thanks for the lift

Steves place is pretty far away from everything but hes letting me stay on his couch for free so

And you were supposed to be my meal ticket

LAUGHS Yeah

PHONE CHIMES

Hold on CJ called

Cj Hey uh just wanted to let you know about a great new story Im chasing

Its a cautionary tale of two young entrepreneurs who flew too close to the sun

I mean apparently in the midst of losing millions they threw a huge party they couldnt afford

I talked to two bartenders and a caterer who worked your party the other night

None of them have been paid Call me

Well it appears we spent our last dime acquiring a tech blog whose chief focus is chronicling our demise

SIGHS And JianYang

JianYang Erlich Bachmann is your refrigerator running

This is Mike Hunt

Oh here here it is on the right

Thanks man Hey uh are you sure youre cool with me taking both cannonballs

Im sure

Thanks partner

I got it

I know you lied

COUGHS

Sorry

What the fuck

Are you okay

Yeah Im fine

How the hell did you know that I was here

Well we have godview on the beta and I saw you leave your office and come here

So youre stalking me

Look Monica I know youre lying about not using the beta so why havent I heard from you

Richard

No its okay

If you dont like it you can say it

Everybody loves it so I think I can handle one negative review

Fine I dont like it

Really

Are you serious Everybody else loves it

Ive never wanted to like something more in my life Richard

I just I dont

Okay

What specifically do you not like about it

Specifically

All of it

I mean its not its not the UX or the design or anything that you can tweak

Its just the whole thing feels engineered

Okay Well that might make sense because um Im an engineer

Look youve gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback

The build is incredibly stable and youre out of money

So if you think its ready you should launch and unlock the next three million

Look Monica I I value your opinion and youre the one that doesnt like it so I dont know

Richard look

I passed on Slack

Really

I never told Laurie Shed probably fire me if she knew but I had a chance to buy 20 percent of Slack for nothing and I passed

I didnt get it I still dont

I mean what is it Is it email Is it a chat room

Turns out the answer is its a three billion dollar company

But thats the fucked up thing about what we do

Sometimes our opinion is wrong

And no matter how good something is theres always gonna be someone who doesnt get it

And unfortunately with Pied Piper its me

Um a week ago I was worried about releasing a beta no one would like

Im just bummed that youre the one that doesnt like it

Which is why you cant listen to anyone else

If you believe in something dont let anyone talk you out of it including me

Peter Gregory always said Dont invest in products invest in people

I invested in you and if you think its ready to go I will go to Laurie and fight like hell for it

So what do you want to do

Laurie Congratulations everyone

Yeah I cant believe it

Were actually finally launching

Yes Tuesday 900 am

Pats on the back Pats on the back

Gentlemen I just realized Ive forgotten to take a shit

So uh Ill see you back at the old homestead

Okay

Laurie

I have a business proposition Id like to discuss with you

Its about my shares in Pied Piper

Okay T minus five minutes

Dinesh are you still seriously squashing bugs

Not really Im so fucking tired Im creating more than Im fixing

Where the fuck is Gilfoyle

This isnt easy for me to do

You served me well old friend

But were transferring to AWS now and Im afraid you cant come

Oh Im pathetic

Id rather have a bunch of fake friends than be best friends with a fucking metal box

Cant you two see

Youre each others best friends

Both fuck you Jared

Yeah Jinx

You owe each other a friendship

Dinesh One minute Holy shit

Holy shit

PHONE RINGS
