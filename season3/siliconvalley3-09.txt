Female narrator Tables Tables are made so a person can sit down and do something Or nothing Any person can sit at a table and if the table is large enough many people To make jokes eat a meal tell stories Tables are for people to be together and share And that is why tables are like Pied Piper Grapefruits postcards hugs These are things people share to connect to come closer To open up about ideas and things that make us feel alive like air ballet amazing haircuts weird countries threealarm chili mountains continents the Earth life Life is beautiful and sad and hopeful and dangerous So maybe the reason we share so much is because we understand that without sharing we cant survive And sharing is tables

WHISPERS Pied Piper

Yes Tables I see Its a metaphor

Its a wonderful ad spot

Yeah Were all just tables

I love what youve done with the place

Its a really nicely done place

Say is that your dog

Its a dog

You and I have never really had much of a rapport have we

Its wanting

Oh look

Well were almost there Prepare to gather everyone

No I didnt say to gather I simply said prepare to gather

Richard Monica hey

Oh hey Hows it going

You holding up okay

Not really

I know Her parties are always deeply weird

Hey um I guess this is as good a time as any to say it but um Im really sorry for not getting Pied Piper

And to be honest its really embarrassing to be so fucking wrong

Well heres the thing you uh you might not be

What What are you talking about

Uh okay

So well Pied Piper launches and everythings great and we spent a fucking bazillion dollars on the Tables ad and now we are almost at 500000 installs right

Yeah Whats the problem

Well as you know installs isnt really the metric that matters

We need daily active users people who come back to the platform

Okay so how many daily users do you actually have

Okay what would what would be a number that would make you say Ugh oh thats bad

I dont know like 100000

Oh

Are you less

How much less

19000

19 19000 less than a hu

81000

No No just 19000

Thats the only number

What

Thats thats terrible

Yeah Im aware

Well yeah thats art not a chair

Oh

Richard Oh my well you havent told Laurie yet have you

No

Okay Well who else knows

Dinesh and Gilfoyle

No

Erlich

ERLICH LAUGHS

No

Monica Well apparently Jared knows

THEME MUSIC PLAYING

Yeah Pied Pipers sort of what Im known for but Im into a lot of cool stuff

Like a lot

You seem surprised

I'll give you an example A few months ago Im at my computer freestyling just kind of jammin out you know before I knew it I had thrown together the greatest videochat app the world has ever seen

So you invented Skype a few months ago

Great ideas just sort of flow through me

The platform you know its sort of a group project but uh the videochat app thats my solo album

Oh Robert

Im Dinesh

What the fuck is going on with you

Hmm Could you be more specific

Youre hiding something

LAUGHS NERVOUSLY What No Im not

Everythings fine You know everythings fine

Thats a lie

I can tell because you subscribe to traditional JudeoChristian mores of right and wrong

Youre made uncomfortable by untruth

CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY

My commitment to LaVeyan Satanism grants me certain freedoms

There is no good and evil theres only self

Would you like a beverage

Yes I would

Lie You just want me to go to the bar and leave you alone

LAUGHS NERVOUSLY COUGHS

Gil you crack me up

Lie

CHUCKLES

I terrify you as I should

LAUGHS Get out of here

Okay thank you

Okay so I just spoke with my friend who runs a market research firm shes gonna set up a focus group for the platform put it in the hands of some real users and hopefully it'll be super obvious whats going wrong

Okay great

Clink clink clink Gather

Faster please Gather faster Were close

We need to see the numbers change

All 499995 499996

499997

CHEERING

Its going great Uh theyve been engaging with the platform for about an hour now

Theyre just starting the Q and A

Richard Uh great

Thank you everyone for sharing your feelings on the revolutionary new Pied Piper platform

Now Bernice you say here that you were totally freaked out by the platform

What specifically totally freaked you out

Everything Just every single thing about it

Just like how it worked

Man Now who else found themselves totally freaked out by this platform

Barry Warren Natalie Martina Gwen Amy Walker and Clay

You were all totally freaked out

Was anyone not totally freaked out

Clark Good What was your reaction

It just made me feel stupid

This file sync thing is confusing

When I put videos into my main folder it says it uploaded them but then I didnt see where they went

It said stuff was on my phone and my iPad but when I looked at the memory it said zero K used so stuff wasnt on there

Thats the platform Hes describing the platform and whats great about it Well clearly he doesnt get it clearly none of these people get it Maybe this is a bad group

This is the fifth one today and its the least hostile reaction weve seen

Okay well everyone that I showed the beta to loved it Loved

Oh shit

What

Who did you give the beta to

Your friends Engineers

Well yeah Monica

I wanted to give it to people who would understand what Im trying to do so I could get useful feedback

And with all due respect I gave it to you the one person without a computing background and you said it felt engineered

Oh shit

Yeah

Youre trying to sell the platform to regular people but you never actually put it in the hands of regular people

Like them

Shouldnt there be a download button

Did they honestly forget to add a download button

You know what Richard why dont we just go

I mean who designed this thing

I did I designed it

Excuse me Who are you

Uh my name is Richard Hendricks Im the CEO of Pied Piper

Oh my God

Oh youre the one who forgot the download button

Yes

But no No actually there is no download button because um well you dont need a download button Were past that

I mean thats the old thing This guy actually he should have told you that

Im a moderator not an advocate

Okay well with Pied Piper you dont need to download anything or send anything at all anywhere because the second you take a photo or a video or compose a text message its on all of your devices instantly

So its all on my phone

Yes

Wrong It says zero K used so its not on there

Aha CHUCKLES Aha

Yes well thats the best part about the platform right there

Yes uh because youre right its not actually on the phone

But you dont need it to be on the phone if you can see it on the phone even though theres nothing there at all

But where the hell is it

Everywhere

And nowhere sort of

INDISTINCT CHATTERING

Let me uh let me just take a step back here and explain it in a simpler way

Um sorry what was your name

Bernice

Bernice What did you have for breakfast today

Scrambled eggs

Scrambled eggs

And whats in the eggs

Electrons Right

And we all know how electrons exist in orbitals

Multivalent states No

No one knows this Okay

Okay thats fine Bad example Thats on me

I'll Im going to use the whiteboard here

Youre gonna youre gonna love this Okay

Then once we hit a critical mass of users the volume of data moving through the system will enable the neural net to start optimizing the platform

It will actually get smarter and faster all on its own

Is that like when Im texting and my phone starts guessing what Im going to say

This goes way beyond autocomplete

Actually all of your devices will begin helping each other in ways that we cant even design or predict

Okay but see the problem is Terminator

What No No no No no no No

I can assure there is no Skynet type of situation here

No Pied Piper will in no way become sentient and try to take over the world

He just told us he couldnt predict it

Im just saying everybody died

All Mmhm yeah

Richard Youre right

In those movies there were a lot of casualties

Quite scary to think

Its food for thought

Speaking of

Can we order some pizzas in here

So when we put our files into a Pied Piper folder they get split up into tiny bits and spread across a network of other users devices

Yes thats uh peertopeer distribution Continue

But they cant look at any of our files because they only have tiny scrambled pieces of them

Encrypted sharding

Clark with the assist Great

Uh go on

But we can look at any of our files anytime anywhere even though theyre not actually on any of our devices

Yes Yes Bernice thats it

Thats Pied Piper Thats everything

So its all on our phones even though it sort of isnt

Oh my God Thats awesome

Isnt it Yeah

So uh what do you think Will you use Pied Piper now

Well yeah I think I will

Me too now that youve explained how it works

There you go

Thats what weve been aiming for

Richard They get it

Whats he smiling at

This data was corrupted the second he walked in that room

So were tanking and its because were too good

Thats one way of looking at it Uh yes

Yes we have created a product so far ahead of its time people are having difficulty wrapping their heads around it

Well then we just need to change the platform right

We simplify it

Richard Well we cant

Its not as if I dont want to its just that we literally cant do it

Um if you build an airplane and people are afraid of anything that flies you cant just take the wings off of it because at that point all youre left with is a really slow super expensive shitty bus

No uh we built an airplane we got to fly it

Whats the point of flying if its fucking empty

I think people will want to fly once they realize how cool the platform is

Guys I know were in a tough spot right now and I know we needed a quarter million DAUs in order to get our next round of funding but this is it

I think we can do this All we got to do is just take every last dollar that we have which is uh Sorry uh Jared what

Well after the Table ads the salaries recruiter fees

You know what I havent run the numbers

It would be irresponsible to estimate

Okay uh is it less than a million dollars

Oh God yeah

Okay

Its higher than 500000 right

Yeah

I guess its about 697240 But dont quote me on that

Okay we use that money to do outreach tutorials user meetups uh create a guerrilla marketing campaign that explains how cool the platform is

I know its not ideal but um I really think we can pull this off

Yeah that seems doable

Lie

Or heres another idea We could put the platform on hold take the money we have left and pivot to something that doesnt require hours of explanation

You know Ive been showing people the videochat app that I hacked together and

Shut up Dinesh

You ungrateful pricks all of you

Your tepid response to our intrepid boss makes me ill

His plan will it work Mmmm

Almost certainly not

All of you will likely look back at this time in your lives and realize you wasted a whole year with nothing to show for it

But if this company is a plane then this is Richards gddmn plane and if he wants to fly it in the side of a fucking mountain that is his prerogative and it is our duty to climb on strap in and have a fiery death right behind him

Richard I dont I dont know about that but

Richard the floor

Crashing aside I think this is the plan and uh really what other option do we have

Well I know what option I have

I can quit So I quit

Okay Any anybody else

Guys no

Look Douglas customer support is going to be a big part of this

We need you guys if were going to get 250000 users

I barely have any customers to support Richard

And the only way youre going to get that many users is if you go to one of those click farms in Bangladesh and pay for them Good fuckin luck man Im out

Guys wait

Jared let them go

I have to do their exit interviews

I guess I can do them on their walk to their cars

Richard were better off without them




    push

Lie

This is intolerable A man can only take so much

Banished from my own company No

Im just going to give them what they want Im going to resign

We can go to Haiti build orphanages

Haiti

Is it not said that one should think globally and act locally

Im not acting at all

Lao Tzu teaches the best fighter is never angry

More important than the blow is knowing when to strike

Like perhaps after we experience the executive white water rafting trip in Coeur DAlene

Gavin do you have a moment

Yes

Alone

Of course Denpok

What

Give us a moment please

Gavin Im really not supposed to be talking to you but theres something I think you should know about

Im listening

A customer service rep that just left Pied Piper is on campus right now interviewing for a job

Why would anyone leave Pied Piper now

I thought maybe youd want to ask him yourself

Well done Well done

Okay Thank you for coming in Douglas

Yeah

Right this way Okay

Uh

Douglas

Consider the possum Natures

Gavin if youre bringing another animal into this board room this meeting is over

Of course not Dont insult me

Gentlemen and lady of the Hooli board I am the possum to which I refer

Playing dead to outwit those who wish me harm

But its time to end the charade

Im sorry Gavin What charade

For months Ive led the world to believe that my Endframe division was pursuing a broadbased compression platform in direct competition with Pied Piper

But secretly I knew that any such platform was destined to fail

But Pied Piper is not failing

Its the most popular app in the Hooli store

One of the most installed yes

But I happen to know because I make it my business to know that their daily active user numbers are abysmal

So you were never developing a platform

Why didnt you tell us this

Says the chairperson of the board that recently asked for my resignation

Trust cuts both ways I thought it best to leave you out of it

Im sorry Gavin Im just finding all of this impossible to believe

If you were never building a platform what did we just spend threequarters of a billion dollars on

Im not going to tell you

Instead Im going to let the new head of product for HooliEndframe tell you

Hello everyone

Im Jack Barker and Im very excited to introduce HooliEndframes newest product

We call it The Box

Gavin Pied Pipers loss is Hoolis gain

May the best product win

INDISTINCT CHATTER

Can I get you a shirt sir There you go

Actually let me ask you a question uh Emily

What did you have for breakfast today

Um yogurt

Okay

And uh we all know whats in yogurt right

Electrons Multivalent states

Welcome to the Pied Piper Informational Seminar

Gavin John

Jack John

This is Pied Piper guys Okay

If I could just explain it one more time

Guys Please dont leave I beg you

Hi Bernice Yeah

 Just look just look 
 Just look what death gone and done 
 Just look just look 
 Just look what death gone and done 

We kind of thought we nailed it with Tables but you say you want something light fun inviting

But most of all you want something that delivers a stepbystep guide to all of the nuances of your platform

Yeah

All of this with the caveat that you dont have enough money for even a minuscule ad buy

Um yes thats right

Thats a pretty small target to hit

Anyway heres what we came up with

HIGHPITCHED VOICE Oh hello welcome to Pied Piper

How can I help you

PIPE TRILLS

What in the name of fuck is that

Well his name is Pipey the Pied Piper Piper

Hes fun And uh you know the demos interactive Just

Looks like you want to compress a movie file

Can I help You know with Pied Pipers revolutionary neural network optimized sharded data distribution system its just six clicks away Follow me

I like it

Thats a fuckin lie

Yeah

So Richard you want us to take the most sophisticated and technically complex compression based platform ever created and add that

Pipey Still here

PIPE TRILLS

Well after the booths at CES and South by Southwest all of our outreach the Dodge Challenger

Pipey Still here

Plus all the cost of working up you know this we are pretty much all out of money

Follow me

Okay

Pipey Uhoh Somebody seems confused

Let me walk you through Pied Pipers proprietary peertopeer content distribution system consisting of

 I found a new meaning

KNOCK ON DOOR

Jared Richard Are you indisposed

Richard can I come in

Richard Im Im sorry the guys didnt like Pipey

Its over Jared

Well you know a lot of animated characters have rough starts

Early Bugs Bunny cartoons were just garish displays of antiJapanese hysteria and now hes the face of Warner Bros

Im not talking about Pipey Jared Im talking about Pied Piper

Were dead We fought Gavin Belson Russ Hooli the lawsuit that fucking box all so we could build our platform the way we wanted to

And we did but I guess you just cant fight public opinion except for one woman named Bernice

Face it Jared being too early is the same as being wrong

Hey

Well figure it out

I dont know if we will

Besides I think Im getting tired of being kicked in the balls

Come on we have a few weeks of runway left

Uh I dont want to say exactly how much

Again Im not comfortable estimating but

Take whats left of it and divide it up amongst the guys

I mean it wont be anywhere close to what youre owed in back pay but at least its something

Dont give up Richard come on not yet

Weve got to hang on weve got to see what happens

Something will turn around I know it will

You really believe that Absolutely

Gilfoyles right youre youre a terrible liar

Um just uh set an allhands for tomorrow at 9 am

And I'll I'll tell the gang

Its over Jared

And lastly our deal to furnish Endframe boxes to Maleant Data System Solutions has officially closed putting us far ahead of even the most optimistic profit targets issued by this very board

Gavin it appears we owe you an apology

Wed like to restore your full status as CEO and chair with a significantly revised bonus and stock options package

Thank you

Of course apology accepted

I would like nothing more than to move forward in a harmonious and productive manner

Actually with that in mind theres something Id like to show you

Its outside Is is that all right

A little field trip if you will

Just down here

A little farther

Were almost there

Just out here everyone Almost there

Consider the elephant

Legend has it its memory is so robust it never forgets

And I assure you gentlemen of the Hooli board and lady neither do I

CLEARS THROAT Okay guys uh we need to have a serious discussion about the future of the company

ALL LAUGHING

What Why is everyone smiling

Richard something happened last night

The daily active users are up way up

Look at it Look

Really

Holy shit

Did we just get 7000 users in a day

We sure did Were back

I dont know if it was the outreach or the tutorials but we seem to be getting traction

Richard you pulled us out of a nosedive

Of course inevitably we will run out of fuel and plummet towards the Earth leaving only a crater behind of torn flesh and excrement but in the meantime we are flying high

Yeah I guess we are

You know its crazy just last night I was uh telling Jared that I thought we should shut down the company

Well perfect timing then huh

PHONE RINGS

Uh excuse me I should get this

Hey Jared

Are those numbers legit

Of course

All right then

This is Jared

Man on phone So are we happy

Yeah Worked out great

So lets keep the 7000 users that I bought and add another thousand a day for the next week
