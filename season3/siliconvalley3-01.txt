THEME MUSIC PLAYING

Richard Thanks for coming Ron

Ron Id bail on spin class any day for you Richie

Richard Richard

I kept calling you werent answering

Talk to the hand Monica

Richard can you stop I can explain okay

Its pretty selfexplanatory Monica You voted to fire me

What the fuck

I mean there is no way Im letting you push me out of this

Our intention is not to push you out

We wish rather to transition you to a more appropriate role within the company

A new CEO will be brought in to manage daytoday operations while you assume the role of Chief Technology Officer

Congratulations

CTO Yes

You want me to be an employee at my own company

You would still be in charge of the engineering and youd continue vesting your shares and keep your board seat

The same seat I had an hour ago when you voted to fire me as CEO

That came in handy

Richard please

I realize this may be bittersweet but earlier this evening Raviga decided to officially fund Pied Piper Series A Round at 5 million at a 50 million valuation

Essentially you have created a company that is too valuable for you to run

You should feel good about that

Are you kidding me I made the company okay

Im the one who came up with the name Pied Piper

Yeah

Ron can I have a word please

They cant really do this can they

I think they just did

You remember that shit deal you brought me from Hanneman and I said Hey Richie this is a shit deal but you took it anyway because you wanted to do something crazy for once in your life

Yes I remember

Well you basically just loaded a gn and handed it to Hanneman and Hanneman sold that gn to Raviga and then Raviga just fucking pistolwhipped you

But hey at least theyre letting you keep your shares and your board seat

You lose a little blood with the dilution for the new CEO but Ive seen worse

Like that shit deal you brought me from Hanneman

CHUCKLES

If we give Richard a little bit of space hell be able to wrap his head around this and a smooth transition to a new CEO will be possible

To wit I served as the CEO of Aviat

Mr Bachman

In the version of Pied Piper in which I am invested you will not be CEO Not now Not ever

Well you madam are a shrew of the first order

Okay Im not gonna let you do this

Im gonna fight it

I understand youre upset

As you can see this is a very emotional time for me as well but we have some very strong candidates coming in for the CEO position and we would so appreciate your input

My input

Mmm

You want me to help you pick my new replacement

Id rather quit

And I dont care how much money I lose because I am gonna get it all back when I sue the living shit out of you

Okay All right All right

Ron lets go

Sorry Im forced to inform you that I can no longer provide you with legal counsel

What are you talking about Youre my attorney

No Technically Im Pied Pipers corporate counsel and you just declared your intention to walk

So in effect you kind of just threatened to sue me and I dont take kindly to threats Mr Hendricks

Mr Hendricks

What happened to Richie

Unfortunately Im not at liberty to discuss him with you either Mr Hendricks

 

Monica Richard if I didnt vote to remove you then Laurie wouldve adjourned the meeting replaced my seat on the board with someone else at Raviga and then they wouldve voted to remove you

At least this way Im still in the game

No You mean at least this way you kept your job

At least the actual Judas had the courtesy to kll himself after betraying his leader Jesus Christ

Hes the CEO of the world Ever heard of him

Yeah Got it Went to Catholic school

Really How long

Look Im still on the board of this company

Ill be in all of the meetings

Maybe I can be helpful at some point

You wanna be helpful Monica

Convince Laurie to keep me on as CEO

Look I know I made some mistakes I wasnt perfect but Ill get better Ill even go to one of those CEO coaches like that guy at fucking Twitter

Richard its done

Laurie already found a new CEO

What Already

You said that you didnt want to be part of the interview process so they picked someone this morning

Jack Barker Hes an incredibly skilled topnotch CEO

I dont care who he is okay None of us do

KEYBOARDS CLICKING

Action Jack Barker

Seriously They picked that grayhaired fossil over me

You said you turned the job down

I said it was mutual

Oh

What Thats accurate

He ran Entercross Systems

They IPOed in 1998 for more than a billion dollars

Yeah 20 fucking years ago

Tech 10 What has he done lately

After that he ran Turnwire for four years until it was acquired by Microsoft for 2 billion

Holy shit This guys a hitter

He was in the oughts Whats he done in the 20teens

Looks like he started a foundation in his mothers name to cure cancer

Yeah hows that going SCOFFS

Yeah I bet his mothers dead

Yeah thats probably why he started the foundation

Richard Lauries meeting with him tomorrow

You should come in and talk with him

No fucking way

Think this through I mean you have to know that you cant start another compression company

No VC will fund that out of fear of being sued and unless you have some totally different gamechanging idea lying around

So youre saying that Im fucked if I leave

No Im saying that

Okay Well then I guess Im fucked because Im out

And when I leave Jareds out Dinesh is out Gilfoyle is out

Everybodys out

So good luck with the company there Monica

Itll just be you Laurie Bream and some fucking asshole who cant even cure cancer

Hes right

Where Richard goes I go

Monica excuse how high I am but are the uniforms in Catholic schools as lowcut as they are online

fuck off

Did you tell Richard you were out

No Did you

No

Are we out

Hmm

 

MURMURING

Did Gavin tell you what this is about

We havent spoken in some time

APPLAUSE

Thank you all for coming on such short notice

I have a difficult announcement to make

We in the tech business often refer to failure as a good thing

Failure is growth

Failure is learning

But sometimes failure is just failure

I think

 

Im sorry

I didnt think it would be this hard

But goodbyes are always hard especially when I am the one saying goodbye

Today effective immediately I Gavin Belson founder and CEO of Hooli am forced to officially say goodbye to the entire Nucleus division

MURMURING

All Nucleus personnel will be given proper notice and terminated

But make no mistake

Though theyre the ones leaving it is I who must remain and bear the heavy burden of their failure

It is my fault

I trusted them to get the job done

But that is the price of leadership

Thank you

APPLAUSE

That was the gutsiest thing Ive ever seen

Amazing

So wait does that mean

Uh Denpok

Can I have your Big Gulp

 

I know we keep saying this but even though Richard is a great guy

And a brilliant coder

Hes wonderful

Nevertheless he is lacking in certain managerial capacities

Totally fair

Its fair right

Hes still a great coder

And an amazing human being

Okay look

Such

We have a lot of shit we want to say about him

Do we have to keep prefacing it with all this niceguy stuff

I mean if so were gonna be here all night

Yeah we kind of do though just to offset the shittiness of all the shitty stuff

What if we use like a dictionary patch

To compress all the niceguy stuff

Like an acronym

Exactly

Richard is great but you know

RIGBY

Rigby

Rigby is all the niceguy stuff

Okay Rigby

But he just assumed we were gonna leave with him which is kind of total bullshit right

Thats really arrogant

Rigby We gave up our own apps so that we could bust our asses for him

Why the fuck should we give up our Pied Piper shares right when we get funded because hes too much of a prima donna to let someone experienced come in and run the company the way its supposed to be run

Rigby

Rigby

Now Im actually getting kind of fucking angry

I mean we put in so much work for no pay and now he thinks hes gonna walk out on us

I mean seriously fuck that guy

fuck him Rigby

What are we gonna do

Rigby

Rigby

Richard I have something that might cheer you up

What is this

Go on Gloomy Gus open it

Okay

So this is a box of files with companies information on it

No These are all companies that I took the liberty of reaching out to that are actually offering you the job of CTO

Really

Some of these companies are pretty good

Flutterbeams like really good

Of course it is They all are

Youre the belle of the ball and these are all your swains hoping for a glimpse of ankle

 

Ah The nest wherein the asp doth coil

Wheres Richard Is he coming

Nope

Congratulations youve successfully broken a good man

Is that Barker

Uh yeah

What are you gonna do

I just spent the last 16 hours cherrypicking Friars Roasts for the premium oldman jokes

Essentially Im going to beat him to death with his own titanium hips

Not just for me but for Richard

Jack Barker aka Action Jack

We meet at last

Erlich Bachman

Mr Bachman

Pleasure to finally meet you

Im a big fan

Oh really Of what Metamucil

Polio The phonograph

A nice piece of fish

Segregated water fountains

Senior citizen discounts at Perkins Family restaurants

Erectile dysfunction because of corroded penile arteries

Deviled eggs as an entrée

Liking Ike

No

None of those Mr Bachman

I am a fan of yours

Have been ever since you were at the helm of Aviato

You know Aviato

Yes Aviato

My Aviato

Is there any other Aviato

Well legally there cannot be




    push

Mr Barker pleasure to meet you

Is that a poppy seed muffin

Yes sir

Well Poppy wants one cause Mommy already got hers

LAUGHS

Hooli stock jumped seven percent today on this news that Gavin Belson is writing down the entire Nucleus project

Whats happening here

It was a courageous move

Hes a straight shooter and obviously Wall Street is responding to that

Woman So what else do you think

So by our account just under 50 percent of Hooli employment agreements include a noncompete clause

The same clause that caused us to lose the Pied Piper lawsuit in arbitration and are thus legally invalid calling into question some of our IP ownership

Shit I was afraid of that

But hypothetically this also presents an opportunity

Any of those people could be dismissed with no severance

Any unvested stock would return to the company option pool

So in other words we have the right to terminate any of those people with no repercussions whatsoever and wed actually make money

Correct

You know our annual individual performance reviews showed a 20 percent incidence of substandard work

So essentially one out of every five Hooli team members deserve to be fired

Oh Im sorry What

So are you nervous

No actually I feel pretty good

Flutterbeam was the best company we looked at

Their tech is great Their offer is amazing

Actually Im kind of pumped

Well your pumpedness makes me pumped

You just got okay

Ill do it

Yeah

All right Well Jared we gotta one day figure out what were gonna do for you for a job

Richard youll go Youll establish yourself and when the time is right youll send for me

Richard you have to talk to this man

Who Barker Pass

This guy is real okay Richard

With his managerial skills and your talent as an engineer we could be talking about the Dword here

dick

No Decacorn

A company thats valued over 10 billion before its initial public offering

All right

Hes still at Raviga for another hour

Please go talk to him

Sorry I cant do that Im already set up at Flutterbeam

Whose CEO unprompted said A brain like Richards comes along once in a generation

Sorry Im just proud

Yeah Yeah yeah yeah

Richard Im not asking you to spoon with the guy or even fork him

What Im asking for

What is that

Forking is when you use your dick and your two legs to stab him in the lower torso

Im asking for you to take 10 minutes and talk to him before you throw everything that we built away

And yes I did say we

I mean if you want to stop by Raviga its on the way to Flutterbeam

I mean I threw some Tysonlevel haymakers at this guy

Richard he didnt flinch

He floats like a butterfly

Hey Richard

Whats going on

Weve been talking

Richard Okay

Guys this isnt really a great time Richard

We wanna tell you something Right

Yeah its something important

Maybe later So Richard

Guys come on

We know youre leaving

Yep Well aware

but

Were not Yeah

were gonna stay at Pied Piper

LAUGHS

Really

Why are you laughing

Im sorry Wow

Well its just that you really think that youre gonna be able to scale the platform without me

gddmn it

Yeah

You dont think we can

Well I know you cant

Thats a bold statement

Richard

We have massive tech debt

You really think that you can scale and deploy my library without any input from me

Are you serious here

Yes we do

Yeah

Then I guess you are truly delusional

Well I think youre an arrogant prick

Im the arrogant prick

Okay This is coming from two people who think they know everything about code they didnt even write

We wrote a lot of the code

You wrote some of it

You know what Were gonna stay and were gonna build Pied Piper just to prove you wrong

Okay Thank you for the solidarity by the way and sticking with your friend

You know what Erlich

You can tell Barker to go fuck himself so I can go to Flutterbeam and then watch these two assholes crash and burn trying to build out Pied Piper by themselves

Thisll be great

SIGHS Great timing guys Thank you so much

Premium stuff Dinesh

Richard Richard

DOOR CLOSES

Well we are now living in a postRigby world

 

Man this place is amazing

Yeah We raised a shit ton of money

Were growing fast as balls

But were not exactly super psyched with the quality of our engineering

Well its a good thing Im here then right

Yeah

All joking aside I actually have a few thoughts on your video platform if you

Were pretty happy with the basic platform

We want to hand you something way cooler

Its kind of like a secret project

I got to warn you though Its pretty rad

Sit right here

Okay

All right

Oh Hello

This is the present

You ready to go to the future

Sure

Three two one

Bam

Oh I I have a mustache

fuck yeah you do

And check this out

Turn your head See that

Compositing perfect 3D holographic mustaches using depthsensing cameras in a live video chat

And no ones doing it

Nobody

Sorry This is the this is the rad thing

Look Richard we agree okay

Were not there yet

Were using a crappy plugin so the latency is bad

You turn too fast that mustache is on your ear

But with your help we think we can cut our stache lag to just 20 milliseconds motiontophoton in nine months

Just in time for Movember

So which one do you want on your employee badge

Tom Selleck

Computer Aloha

Ooh Fu Manchu

GONG PEALS

John Waters

Not bad

Alex Trebek htler

Probably not htler Skip him

Oh yeah

Bam Sam Elliot

Computer Howdy

Sure

PHONE BUZZING

Oh Uh

Okay so weve got to hop on a call with biz dev

Okay

but feel free to keep on staching Okay

There you go

All right

Hey if you want to have your attorney look over the employment agreement and the stock option grant its cool by us all right

Just sign it Youre in

Well see you Monday man

Were pumped

Okay Well your pumpedness makes me pumped

SIGHS

Uh uh

Pete Monahan please Its Richard Hendricks

I just need him to go over a contract for me

What

BUZZER BLARES

Are you an attorney here to see a client

No Actuallt Im a client who is here see my attorney

Okay Follow me

It began as a innocent celebration of our arbitration victory

I ordered a kombucha which I did not realize contained alcohol

It was described to me as a healthy organic tea

Next thing I knew I was 70 miles away wrapped naked in a blanket shaking off a meth high and facing charges for attacking a police horse with a shovel

Oh Holy shit

From a legal standpoint it was a clear violation of my parole and I must now serve my entire sentence

Okay

and any additional time stemming from the new charges which continue to accrue

But Im owning my mistakes

Oh

I am staying positive

Enough about me

Lets take a look at that contract

Okay

I would redline it but

Im not allowed to have a pencil

Oh

 

This makes less sense the more I look at it

Okay Whats this number over here

I dont know

I didnt handle the compression library

Neither did I

Youre telling me Richard did this all on his own

Shit I thought you did it

Now I respect you even less

We each know 90 percent of the platform but its the same 90 percent

Maybe that arrogant prick was right

We cant scale it without him

We are so fucked

Wait

Yeah

I got it

 

We quit out of solidarity with Richard

Thats interesting

So even though he said all that horrible shit to us we take the high road and we get his back

Yeah

Maybe hell even hire us at his new company

Flutterbeam

Mustaches

Yes

Doesnt necessarily have to stop at people

They can put mustaches on their pets too

Its actually pretty fun

So soon youll be putting mustaches on cats and dogs and snakes

Snakes yeah yeah

I mean its a little tricky because they dont have a philtrum so finding an anchor point for that mustache is actually gonna be quite of a technological challenge

Its exciting stuff

It really is

Richard

Let me ask you something

Why are you leaving Pied Piper

They pushed me out

I thought they offered you another position

Yeah CTO Its a demotion

Well wouldnt you be CTO at Flutterbeam

Yes but at least this way I dont have to eat shit

Richard let me tell you something I learned here on the inside

Swallow your pride or soon youll be eating something far worse than shit

Believe me

Dont you think you should at least meet this Barker fellow

SIGHS

 

MURMURING

So where are we

Seventeen hundred people slated for exiting

Their negated options total 780000 shares

That money can be allocated anyway you see fit

Employee bonuses renovations to the daycare center

What have you What should we prioritize

Big Head Sorry I dont understand

Its all in the document

You take that severance package and you leave Hooli immediately

But the most important aspect is the nondisclosure nondisparagement clause in which you agree not to say anything negative in the press in public or in private about Hooli or Gavin Belson

Okay I wont

You will not discuss anything you did at Hooli at all in perpetuity throughout the universe

I didnt really do anything at Hooli so

Good Youre getting the hang of it already

So can I keep my Hooli ID though so I can still come and hang out with my friends on the roof

You cannot

Officially you will no longer have any friends here

Shoot

I have to think about this then

This settlement offer is quite generous

I know I know I mean 2 million is a lot of money

Two No Its

Its 20 million

Twenty

So they fired me before they hired you so its not your fault I just

I feel like this cant really work

Do you understand

I do Richard

Its like can I really be expected to do my best work when I am constantly feeling undervalued at the company that I started

Does that make sense

It does Richard Absolutely

I hear each and every one of your concerns loud and clear and I appreciate your position

Mm

So I guess we just wont do it

Come on Ill walk you out

Wait What

Sorry You what

Jack

Sorry I dont understand

Youre not gonna take the job

Not if youre not

Without you handling the tech I dont see how this company works

Wow I mean yeah I agree

Richard its hard enough running a business when everyone is on the same page

And clearly we are not

Well yeah

No no its fine and I appreciate you being so honest with me

I mean better we find out now right

Yeah

Anyway I hope we each find a good fit somewhere

Thanks for coming up

You got a hell of a brain there Richard Hendricks

You drive safe

Yeah

 

Shit
