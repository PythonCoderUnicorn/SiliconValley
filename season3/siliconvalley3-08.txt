General Keith Alexander is here to tackle techs role in counterterrorism but first a quick glimpse with Richard Hendricks founder and CEO of the hot new compression platform Pied Piper and Erlich Bachman Chief Visionary

Oh Emily Chang it is just splendid to be here with you at historical Pier Three with a breathtaking view of the SPANISH ACCENT Embarcadero Center and the flag of SPANISH ACCENT San Francisco

Now Richard

Richard actually developed this technology in my incubator

I am listed I was originally listed under the white pages as Erlich Blachman uh with an L a typo that apparently couldnt be changed and then Google indexed it so Ive been dealing with that

Richard Pied Piper has taken off like a rocket

More than a hundred thousand installs in just ten days Is that right

Uh uh yes

Pretty amazing

And you have a lastminute invite to the Vanity Fair Summit dinner tonight

Quite an honor for such a young company

Richard maybe you can comment on this one

Yeah we are the finally the the belles of the balls

LAUGHS I mean uh ball

Have you guys thought about that

You could have a billiondollar company

Erlich you could own five percent of a billion dollars

Uh ten actually

Erlich Richard this is boring

Shit

Richard No no no

He was he was an early investor

Again its Erlich Bachman

If you Google that it'll say Did you mean Erlich Blachman

You can click on that link it'll give you the correct results for Erlich Bachman

Should we take some calls

We dont do that here

I just know what I saw Richard

No come on Look shes married she just had another baby

If you pushed a little harder you could have scored right there on camera

You should get her phone number

Shut up

PHONE RINGS

Oh This is actually uh JianYang pranking me

I should take it

Yes of course I have frogs legs Why do you ask

Are you serious Have you honestly still not told him that you sold your shares

You cant keep lying to him like this

Its not technically a lie

My shares dont transfer to Raviga until the next board meeting

Come on its been ten days

I know I know but you know the TechCrunch thing came up and then there was the Reddit AMA and you know now this Bloomberg thing

And besides lets be honest Richard shouldnt be in the public eye without me along to help Did you see the skeevedout look on Emily Changs face

I thought she was going to walk off set

Erlich youre lying to him and you made me a part of it so now Im lying to him too

The longer you wait the worse this is gonna get

All right fine I'll tell him

When

After the Vanity Fair thing tonight I mean did you see the guest list

Monica throw me a bone here

24 hours then Im telling him

Fine I'll tell him I'll tell Richard

Monica Im serious

Monica Im not joking

Um it was uh JianYang

He said to tell you that Phillip McCrevis left word

Oh whos Fillup My Oh

THEME MUSIC PLAYS



Richard wed better get our asses in first fucking gear if we want to make it to this Verge photoshoot

Oh shit Thats today

Yes I assumed thats why youre still wearing your Bloomberg makeup

No

No I was just I kind of like the way it can we just push this to next week please

They dont really do that

Okay well can you go

Please I just have a ton of work and honestly I would be really happy if I never had to do any of this ever again and then you were just the face of the company

You know what I mean Oh shit

What what time is this Vanity Fair thing

Its tonight I figure were wheels up by 600 then we can check into the hotel shit shave and shit again

Get a cocktail

What hotel

Eavesdropping Well if you must know we got a suite at the Fairmont and theyre sending a car

I think Richard deserves it And then I figured tomorrow in the am we would sleep in and have a nice brunch

I dont have time for a brunch I have to be back here

Come on eggs benny a little spinach tartar youll flirt with the waitress

Killer And uh well have a nice talk

Talk What about

You know things all sorts of themes

So tomorrow you me brunch and uh one word frittata

Hey fellas is it me or is it a bit chilly in here

CHUCKLES

What in Gods name is that

What do you think it is Its a jacket

LAUGHS Now I only ordered one as a sample but once I have your sizes we can all have them

Why would we all want them One is already too many

I dont mean in the house I mean like in the world

Now Gilfoyle I have you at about a 40 long Am I right

If my mother was naked and dead in the street I would not cover her body with that jacket

LAUGHS Gilf

Jared now that youre here we need two new tables in the game room Yeah

Okay Well maybe against the doors

Oh hold on theres more

Pied Piper Because awesome worldchanging compression company would take up too much space

And you guys give me shit for a tiny gold chain

I regret nothing Im going to get coffee

Hey Brownie you coming

I was thinking wed hit the Philz on Middlefield

No lets drive to the one on Forest Avenue

Its further from that jacket

Claude youre on pager duty until we get back

Jared can I borrow that jacket

I sense youre doing something ironic with it but Im okay with that because however unattractive this jacket may seem to you once you slip it on everything will change

Itll shake out its hair and take off its glasses and before you know it youll be in love

Jared its really fucking ugly

Gavin Consider the tortoise

As the fable teaches us it may appear that he is losing in his race against his nemesis the insolent and cocksure hare

But appearances can be deceiving

Gavin the tortoise Is it Endframe

Yes But theres more

The hare is Pied Piper

Indeed it is Someones read their Aesop

Weve also read the financials Gavin

Between Nucleus and Endframe youve burned through threequarters of a billion dollars with virtually nothing to show for it

Two weeks ago on the heels of powering down the entire Hooli campus for seemingly no reason you lost all of Endframes senior engineers

I grant you weve stumbled on offense of late but the best offense is a good defense

Weve taken a page out of Apples playbook and are currently reviewing the Pied Piper app for sale in our Hooli store at a pace one might call tortoiselike

Dont They hate that

In any case I have it on good authority that it may be some time before Pied Piper is available on Hooli OS devices

Were making it available immediately

Sorry

Youre fighting a war thats already ended Gavin Pied Piper won

We called this board meeting to inform you that its time for Hooli to let go and move on without you at the wheel

Im sorry without me LAUGHS Are you firing me

Our intention is simply to transition you into a more appropriate role within the company one with less oversight of daytoday operations

Youre putting me on the fucking roof

You could always choose to move on Gavin Up to you

I built this company with my bare hands in my fucking garage

Where were you when I was doing that

Gavin

These animals

fuck

Well uh you are certainly more than qualified to be our new head of PR

Laurie thinks youre great Um to be honest we could use the help

All the media stuff has been pretty overwhelming especially lately

If Marissa Mayer can do it so can you

Oh CHUCKLES

And uh youre available immediately

I am I do have one question for you guys

Is everything here cool

Is it cool Uh yeah

Yeah I mean Im Im cool

Yeah he is cool

Uhhuh

Clearly but is there anything you guys want to tell me about the company

What like uh

All right look this is weird but when I was in Lauries office yesterday I saw a piece of paper on her desk

Well she she can be a bit untidy

It was a sale of a big block of Pied Piper stock

Is someone on the inside dumping shares right as youre launching

What

No No absolutely not

Cause that would be a pretty severe signaling risk

I mean you dont have to be in PR to know that insiders only dump stock like that when they know something is wrong

The bulk of my compensation here would be options and if those arent going to be worth anything

Yeah No No no no

That is not happening okay Nothing is going on here

Yeah except excellence

Okay

Well you let me know what you want to do and I'll think about it

Okay Oh

Um well thanks for coming

What the hell was that

Maybe it was a negotiating tactic

Monica

Its Monica

Well lets not jump to conclusions

I mean shes the only one whos bought a jacket

Jared shes the only one who hates the platform

Theres no other explanation for this Okay Monica fucked us

She pulled down her pants and fucked us in front of her parents

Did some Richard did somebody do that to you

No No I dont know why

Oh boy it is chilly

Good thing I brought this sweet jizacket

Eh friend We came here together

I know what youre doing

You think youre embarrassing me but thats only the secondary effect of that shitty jacket

The primary effect is

EMPHATICALLY that you look like a douchebag

Let me put this in terms youll understand

Im like a su1c1de bomber of humiliation

Im happy to go out as long as I take you with me

Your shame is my paradise

CLEARS THROAT

Sup ladies

What you noshing on Cranberry scone

My friend Dinesh here has a little crush on you Hes shy

I dont know him

Oh he plays coy

I dont know why hes so shy

Excuse me I noticed your jacket

Do you work for Pied Piper

Yeah

Everyone I know is installing it

Do you seriously I just downloaded it last night

Yeah Do you mind if we get a picture

You heard him Youre being a dick

MOUTHS

Boy some people

Woman What a creep

Man Sorry you had to deal with that Jared

Gilfoyle You and me both friend

PHONE RINGS

This is Monica

Is it Because apparently everything else that comes out of your mouth is a lie

Shit

Look Richard I totally understand if youre pissed at me but please know that I tried as hard as I could to get him to tell you

Oh really Well thats not what he said

Oh really What exactly did he say

He said that he found it on a piece of paper in Lauries office

What Wait wait wait Hold on Whos the he that youre talking about

You know who David

My brother

What

Who the fuck I dont know LAUGHS

No David the fucking PR guy whos not going to take a job with us because of what you did

Richard I am totally lost What exactly do you think I did

You can play dumb all you want to It wont change the one thing that both you and I know is true You dumped your stock

What No I didnt dump a single share of my Pied Piper stock

I swear Well then who the fuck did

 

And make sure that the money reads

I mean Pied Piper is a billiondollar company

Its not just a unicorn

All right lets do some rearing

There we go Now lets let the horns sort of look like my dick Perfect

Are you fucking kidding me

Richard

Um can we take a soft five

I was going to tell you Thats what tomorrows brunch was for

Brunch You had ten fucking days and you didnt say a thing

Fine You want to know why I didnt tell you

Because its fucking humiliating Im broke Richard

Did you hear me Im broke

Erlich Bachman the name that used to be synonymous with success went broke and was forced to sell

I got royally fucked Richard

You got fucked

Youre the one who threw a milliondollar party

Yeah but it was a great party

No one forced you to do that

Admit it you fucked yourself

But Im not gonna let you fuck my company

Im going to have to issue a press release explaining what you did and why

No no come on This isnt out

Its one PR guy

That we know of Erlich

How many other people saw that piece of paper

How many people has this guy talked to

This is Silicon Valley

Rumors spread like light speed here

How are we gonna get good people to work for us if they think something funky is going on with our stock

How are we going to scale This is going to kll us

Richard do you know what happens if this goes public

Im Ron Wayne

Who

Ron Wayne The guy that owned ten percent of Apple and sold it in 1976

No one in this town will work with me ever again

You want me to risk the entire future of Pied Piper everything that Ive worked for just to protect you from your own fucking incompetence

Richard theres a three to four percent chance that this is going to get out on its own but there is 100 percent chance that if you issue a press release no one will ever take me seriously again

My dignity is in your hands Richard

Do with it what you will




    push

Gavin Is that you

Jack Barker

Nice plane

Yours too

Where are you headed

I just needed to take a walk and clear my head

Theres this great little hiking trail near my lodge in Jackson Hole

Get out of here Im on my way up to J Hole myself

Is that right I thought you sold

No I just never go there

So how long you going for

Coming back tomorrow afternoon

Me too

Oh come on Come on

Seriously we need to find a couple hours get together catch up

I could tell you some war stories

Well Id love that

I could tell you a few of my own

LAUGHS Well be well

You too

Take care Jack

Yeah

See you

Gavin Wait

Uh what are we doing here

I mean youre on your way to Jackson Hole Im going to Jackson Hole

You seem like you could use some company

You play chess

I do Indeed

Fantastic I tell you when we get up to altitude and the WiFi kicks in Im ActionJB62 on Hooli chat

Find me

I will

Im glad we bumped into each other

Me too

Really is a small world

Its crazy

BOTH LAUGH

Okay well uh I think it reads well

And its all in there This will definitely set the record straight

Then again youre basically lighting Erlich on fire

So what He fucked the company

He potentially fucked the company

Are you kidding me Wh Gilfoyle back me up here

This is thorny

How is this even a question for you guys

Honestly I mean its not like hes going to be out on the street He just sold ten percent of a company thats valued at at least 50 million dollars and now suddenly were giving him the benefit of the doubt

Well it sounds mighty Christian of you Gilfoyle

Theres no reason for hate speech Richard

I can see by the sour pinched expressions on all your faces that Richard has filled you in regarding the unfortunate circumstances that have forced me to relinquish my stake in your fair company

Erlich uh you should know that I have written a press release

Oh

Im not going to release it yet but if I hear wind of these rumors spreading out of control Im going to send it to every tech publication and blog on the face of the earth Do you understand

Even UPROXX

Yes even them

Also uh this is the check for next months use of the house as our office but well be out by the end of the month

Richard it doesnt have to be like this

From this point forward you will have nothing to do with this company whatsoever

Im replacing you on the board and Im giving your seat to Jared

So thats it then

Yes

So I guess we better get ready for that Vanity Fair event

What

Did you not listen to a word I just said

I heard thousands of words about rumors and the need to contain them What do you think would happen if I didnt show up to this Vanity Fair event

Ive already RSVPd and given them a list of phony dietary restrictions just to cause a scene

I told them I was pescapescatarian

Which is one who eats solely fish who eat other fish

I think my absence would be noted

Erlich brings up a good point

Its true

Let us not forget Meinertzhagens Havers

Yes yes Meinertzhagens Haversack

We all remember his sack

SIGHS Okay fine Yeah

Sure You can come I cant stop you

Uh I'll be taking the car and the hotel room and youre going to have to drive yourself

Consider it my farewell dinner

See you at the event

GASPING

Jared are you okay

Its just so many emotions

The board seat I feel regret and glee that you would choose to honor me and terror at not living up to your expectations and compassion for Erlichs loss

Oh Donald youve come undone CHUCKLES SADLY

You still want him on the board

Hi there Checking in Richard Hendricks

fuck me Hey Richie

Oh God Hey Russ

Whats up boy genius You here fucking

Huh No No no no fucking

Just uh here for the Vanity Fair dinner

Oh yeah I know that stupid dinner

Bunch of VC douchebags jerking each other off

Speaking of I got this girl at the bar Im trying to take her up to the presidential suite before her fucking bridesmaids ruin the whole thing but theyre telling me its booked

Who is it Is it Gore fuck that guy

Oh God

I saw Pied Piper launched

Havent tried it probably wont

I dont even want to think about how fucked I got missing out on Erlichs shares fuck

Wait he he tried to sell you his shares

Well half of them He was pretty desperate to stay on the team

Well he didnt mention anything about this to me

Of course not Why would he Its fucking humiliating losing all your money

You think when I dropped below a billion I walked around telling everybody

fuck no You guys were the only ones who knew and I actually thought about having you klled

Im sorry what

So Erlich and I like two weeks ago we had a contract ready five mil I was gonna pay him for half his shares

It was a winwin Then that robot Laurie Bream sweeps in and cockblocks the whole thing

She forces him to sell her all his shares You think shes gay

Maybe It hasnt come up I uh so wait she outbid you

Outbid me No she didnt have to

You dont even know how your own fucking company works LAUGHS

All right Mr Hendricks we have you staying one night in a deluxe double

Okay do you have a tub in that room

Does he have a tub in that room

I dont know Theres no way of telling

You know what fuck it Im gonna take her to the W

Shes so drunk she wont know the difference See you around Richie

PHONE CHIMES

CJ on voicemail Hey its CJ Listen Im hearing a rumor about some serious ugliness going on at Pied Piper

Ive heard it from three different people now You need to call me

fuck

Laurie What in Gods name is the reason to get a higher education

You can just buy a megafreeze for 35 cents

Laurie can I talk to you for a second

Yes uh Richard Hendricks do you know Mark Pincus

Hello

Big fan

Oh okay Yes

Sorry just one second

Yes Oh all right

Im sorry to cut away like this We can continue discussing this

Okay uh look I know Erlich sold you all of his shares

Im just uh wondering exactly how that happened

Ah yes It was one of my finer moments

Erlich came to me with an outside offer to sell half of his Pied Piper shares

To Russ Hanneman for five million dollars Yes I know

But somehow you ended up with all of his shares How

Oh well as you know the same onerous terms you accepted when you took Russ Hannemans money they transferred to me when I bought him out

These included the right to block any transfer of stocks with a majority vote of the board A board which I control

I dont understand

Of course you do

If I have approval of any buyer and I am the only buyer I approve then I can set my own price

So I asked Mr Bachman for a thorough accounting of his debts uh which ran to approximately 713000

And how much did you give him

713000

Jesus So he walked away with nothing

Uh yes And so as I said youre the one who accepted these terms so youre the one who enabled this action on my part

All credit goes to you Richard Excuse me

dick dick Costolo One moment

I need to speak with you

INDISTINCT CHATTER

Man Its expensive to replant

No The vines are bad The soil is bad

CONVERSATION CONTINUES

Excuse me what is that

Thats pescapescatarian

Its fish that

Actually just bring me one of those

Man 4 Youre getting that I want it too Excuse me

Hey I thought you were at the dinner

Erlich never showed Is he here

Yeah Hes hiding in the backyard

Why

Have you not seen the article

No

Is Erlich Bachman the Dumbest Man in Tech

What the hell is this I never sent anything out

Who did they talk to

Erlich

This is CJs blog He outed himself to protect Pied Piper

This is way harsher than anything you ever wrote

Plus theres the visual component

Speaking of wheres your jacket Jared

CLEARS THROAT Thats quite a piece

Informative Thorough

You certainly know how to make an impact

And I guess I dont have to worry about any rumors coming out

Those are handled

You know Erlich uh Pied Piper still needs a head of PR

You seem to be wellversed in media outreach

And by your own admission in that article your head is what did you say  so far up your own ass you can see the future

And that could be useful if we need a precog STAMMERS in a way

Uh I dont know if youre available so

Are you offering me a job

Well we have a good option package

Um it wont be quite what you had but its something

Thats very generous

So things could go back to the way they were before

Well no No Not exactly the way they were

No no Uh well this would be an actual job and you would have responsibilities

Would this job have a title

Something say Chief Evangelism Officer

So CEO

Jared Oh my goodness

What the fuck was that

Richard

The Pied Piper app just got accepted to the Hooli store

What Holy shit

Gavin Belson just presented us with his bare buttocks in submission

LAUGHS We beat him I dont I dont hug No

Um okay hey look uh time to issue your first press release right

Its very late Richard and Im very high

Erlich I dont care

You have to do it okay Now

Its your job

Okay

All right

Oh

JARED LAUGHS

DOOR CLOSES

CJ Cantwell Erlich Bachman

The reason Im calling has absolutely nothing to do whatsoever with the fact that I own half of your blog and everything to do with the fact that I was just named Chief Evangelism Officer of Pied Piper

Feel free to abbreviate that whatever acronym is most economical

And I have a story

Well if its anything like this last one I am all for it

I am getting so many paid views on your tellall

Everyone in the Valley is reading it

Well thats good for you at my expense I guess

Anyway I had no choice

As you said it was going to come out one way or another

Why No one knew about any of it until you told me

What do you mean You said that you had heard from a bunch of people that there are all these rumors about ugly shit going down at Pied Piper

Thats literally the only reason that I told you any of this

What Oh yeah three different people told me that Pied Piper had the ugliest jackets theyd ever seen

Jackets

I was going to do like a whole swag fail thing you know

That could have been cool no

Who the fuck cares about jackets
