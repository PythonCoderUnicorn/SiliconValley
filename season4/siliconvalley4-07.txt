laughing

Thats a good one Richard

No but seriously what brings you in today

No I am I am serious

I would like a an STD check

What did you graze your pen1s against a toilet seat

No

I I had sex

 sex with what

 Female

A female what

A female human

And II dont know this woman very well and we didnt use a condom

Now listen Richard I wouldnt worry so much

People dont really get STDs anymore

Well get your tests back soon and I would tell you not to have sex before then but lets face it lightning aint gonna strike twice is it

 laughing

 Its possible

 Huh

 Its possible

No

Hey heres something strange

Would you mind hopping up on that scale for a sec

Okay why

Am I gaining weight

I have been working like crazy eating like crap

I havent been exercising at all really so Yeah look at that

You are an inch shorter than you were this time last year

Youre shrinking my friend

stammers

How is that possible

Well you just told me

Its your unhealthy lifestyle Richard

Its a loss of mineral bone density

So what do I do

Im gonna put you on calcium supplements and Im gonna have you come back in about three weeks

I'll see you then or whatevers left of you

laughing

Monica So Erlich good news Keenan Feldspar signed his term sheet and we are now officially negotiating the finer points of his deal

Fantastic

Well now the real work begins

To that end we would like to clarify our arrangement with you

We feel that a generous finders fee will be more than satisfactory

This meeting is over

This is very generous but I I was under the impression that um I was going to be hired here and Ive actually told quite a few people that I was hired so if I wasnt then it would look like I was fired

That is fine

No

Laurie I will not allow you to make the same mistake that Uber Palantir Zenefits and in my earlier years Chipotle made by not hiring me

All right dont hire me

But can you hack this finders fee into 52 installments paid weekly over the course of the next year

You mean a salary

Those are your words not mine

The finders fee and 10000 to go away

You know looking around at BreamHall I see a lot of the same the same gender Both partners happen to be female Erlich

Great catch

Whats your point

There is a grotesque gender imbalance in the VC field right now

I can help you navigate the toxicity of this male culture which is encroaching on our feminist island

I mean for instance theres something called mansplaining

 Have you heard about this

 We know what mansplaining is

Mansplaining is when a man will condescendingly explain something to a woman that she already knows

Mr Bachman we have work to do

All right

Laurie half the finders fee for me to stay

I dont think that youll find an associate um with my track record at a better price

Its my final offer

Take it or leave it

I need this

Fine

You may start Monday

Okay

Ooh this Monday

Thats fine

Of course

keyboard clacking

Whats that

SonicWall SonicPoint ACe paired with the TZ600

Topoftheline firewall protection builtin intrusion prevention SSL decryption and inspection application control and content filtering

Saying new router would be so much quicker

Dinesh the one good thing that came out of you slapping your body against that cyberterrorist in a vulgar parody of the act of love is that we finally have a network with real security value

Why would we need it

Mia is in a federal facility with no access to the Internet

Right and she has never shown a proclivity for getting around infrastructure

Did you see this

Weve only been live for two weeks and we just cracked the top 500 in the Hooli app store

Oh look at that

Ranked 499

Of utilities

Yeah subgroup mobile subgroup storage

True but overall were firmly in the top 30000 Hooli phone apps

I mean we may not be a global epidemic yet but weve leapt from bat saliva to humans and and weve just klled our first few villagers

This warm

This warm

This warm

This warm

I get it JianYang

The refrigerator is broken

The ice cream is melting

Let me guess

Is it because its warm

 Yes

 Fine I'll call the repairman and hell come here and fix it posthaste

No I want a new fridge a smarter fridge like this

Fourteen thousand dollars for a smart fridge

Unlike you I now work for a living

Im not gonna drop that kind of dough on a fridge

I ordered it already

I buy it for myself

Then why are you talking to me about it

To make you feel bad because you are fat and poor

phone ringing

 Go for Erlich

 Ed on phone E Bachman

E Chen

Got your message

BreamHall huh

Yes starting today

I hope that this doesnt create any tension between us us now being competitors and all

Ed Hey

Nonezo

Hey while I have you some of the boys are part of the ownership group of the Warriors

We have an extra spot on the floor at Oracle Arena

You a hoops guy

Oops sorry you broke up

Could you uh could you say that again

Ed on speaker We have an extra spot on the floor tonight at Oracle Arena

You a hoops guy

What redblooded American male in the VC boys club isnt

Okay

Cool

I'll text you the deets

 Later man

 phone clicks

Well boys Ive been in the VC game for just one day and already I have floor seats to watch the Warriors

 But you hate basketball

 I'll concede that spending all my time inside of a house with you scrawny code jockeys the Incredible Shrinking Hendricks and whatever the fuck Jared is here may have blunted my conventional masculinity a hair but its always been there

Uhhuh

Well try and get a selfie with Steph Curry

I will assuming shes there

Hey Jared um look at this email here

Uh Dear Richard I recently became aware of your Space Saver app

I think your app may infringe upon my own patented technology

If your schedule permits I would love to discuss this with you as soon as possible

Sincerely Stewart Burke

 I thought we handled that patent stuff

We own it right

Yeah

I'll I'll send him a harshly worded ceaseanddesist letter

Actually uh his work address is some house in Mountain View

Hes probably just working out of his garage just like us

Why dont I go over there walk him through the app you know coder to coder

Im sure it'll be fine

Youve got a big heart

Or maybe it just seems big cause the rest of him is shrinking

knocks

Hi

Richard Hendricks

We exchanged emails

 No

 Are are you Stewart Burke

No

Im sorry

Does Stewart Burke live here

Yeah

sighs

Okay

Is he in

Can I speak with him

Grandpa

Some guys here

My grandson is the software expert

I couldnt tell a computer from a toaster

Oh

So youre not a coder

Oh no not at all

I am an attorney

I started out in the medical field then in the auto industry and then the music business

Did you represent all these people

No I sued them

Look thats me with Stevie Wonder

He never saw it coming

 You get it

 Uh yes because hes blind

 clucks tongue

 Right

Im sorry

I dont know what this has to do with You see this

This is a song I bought at a copyright auction

Its an old mariachi number that had cost me practically nothing and so far has bought me two houses and put my village idiot grandson through six years of Emerson

Oh

All that from Cancion De Amores

 Was it a popular song

 No

I used the copyright on this song to sue writers of all kinds of songs

Anyway the writers usually settle pay me off or give me a chunk of their song

Thanks to Cancion De Amores here I now own 10 percent of Katrina and the Wave Walking on Sunshine

  Mmm

 Its a classic

And when it runs next month on Mazdas new Super Bowl spot I print money

But sadly all the good music copyrights are gone

That is so sad

And thats why I moved into tech

And now I sue people like you

What

So hes a patent troll

Yep as like in buy a ton of superbroad IP from failed startups at auction and then threaten litigation against accused infringers i e  you

So uh how much is Burke asking for

Twenty thousand dollars

Ah youre getting off easy

Well no

Look his patent covers storage of media files on a network

 I mean that cannot be enforceable

Its probably not sighs

but to find out youre gonna have to fight him in court

For a good litigator were talking at least sputters

a couple hundred grand

Just pay him the 20 grand Richard

I could get creative and take some money out of the Melcher deal

 There you go

 Richard No we need that money

This is a shakedown

Hes a crook

And right when our app was getting off the ground

Thats how he found you

Guys just landed on the app store  top 500 list right

 Yeah

So Burke starts at the bottom of those lists and works his way up

The more settlements he gets the stronger his case

The higher you are on the list the more money he asks for

Its like its like limp biscuit

 He sued those guys too

 Not the band

The thing the band is named after

Limp biscuits an old frat ritual where all the brothers race to stroke one out onto a biscuit and then the last guy to nut has to eat it

chuckles

Right

Sometimes its a Wheat Thin

Look Richie I get it

Its embarrassing to pull your pud in front of the whole pledge class

Just pay the guy

Or maybe we convince the entire pledge class to not play the game at all in the first place

chuckles

If only

 clears throat

 fridge chimes

This must be the new fridge

 You like this

 Look it has a screen so you can see all the food thats inside

Mmhmm

Whoops

Did you forget to scan that bar code

Yes I did on purpose

 chimes

 Ah

There we go

Gilfoyle Its bad enough it has to talk

Does it need fake vocal ticks like ah

Well it just makes it sound more human

Humans are shit

This thing is addressing problems that dont exist

Its solutionism at its worst

We are dumbing down machines that are inherently superior

Whatever

You gave your server a human name

You named it Anton

Yeah but Anton doesnt call me anything

He grimly does his work then he sits motionless till its time to work again

We could all take a page from his book

fridge chimes

Uhoh

That yogurt is expired

See

This couldve klled me

Now I can give it to Erlich

fridge closes

chimes

Hmm

 basketball bouncing

 buzzer echoes over phone 

thuds

Hey let me get in

Let me get in

Let me get in

Hey I squished those frontend bugs

 Did you finish your networking issue

 Nope

 fridge chimes

 Hmm

Im sorry

Wrong password

Youre sitting here trying to hack JianYangs password instead of doing your actual work

Well good luck its a 10digit alphanumeric

Ten digit

fuck

And you have one underpowered laptop so you know you should have the answer in 9000 years

Time to pull out the big gn

Well maybe you should pull out the bug gn cause of the network bug

As in the bug youre supposed to be fixing

If you were programmed to have a good sense of humor youd laugh at that

Oh Im sorry

I didnt see any Good Humor ice cream bars

 Shall I add them to your shopping list

 You know what

Yeah

chimes

Good Humor ice cream bars  added to your shopping list

 Jared Come on

God

You believe this

Im Im still on hold

 With

 Microsoft Azure

Yeah I Im trying to negotiate a lower cloud storage rate because were gonna need it if or more realistically when Richard finally decides to pay that patent troll

scoffs

I mean Im still on hold

Its like they dont even care about small businesses

Jared they dont care about small businesses

Thats why small businesses have to lie

Like um Google named their first building Building 40 so that people would think they were already huge

When I worked at my first startup I would transfer people to my supervisor and then Id just get back on the phone myself

Oh

Uh yeah hello

No no Im not gonna go on hold again

Um in fact could I transfer you to my supervisor

chuckles

Oh

whispers

Oh no no no I have to take a shit

Just um do your best Ed Chen impression

Um one moment please

Whats up

You got Ed Ch Chambers

Hello everybody

Thanks again for making it

And thanks to Gus of Gigglybots for hosting

 No problem

 My name is uh Richard Hendricks uh of Pied Piper

Youre the guys working for Gavin Belson

Was working with Gavin Belson yeah

 So hes not coming

 No

No not at all

But I'll have you all know that without any involvement from Gavin Belson Pied Piper just like yourselves has reached the Hooli app stores top 500 list and you guys are aware that you are all directly above us on the list which is why you should know that a patent troll named Stewart Burke has recently demanded that I pay a 20000 licensing fee and if I pay hes gonna come and ask you guys for more money

He starts with the little guy

Not that Im little

Im uh I mean Im not

clattering

Im actually uh above average height

Isnt this something that could have been done over email

I mean I guess but look

If we dont stop this guy hes gonna just keep asking for more and more money until someone is stuck with an unpayable bill

Its kind of like that old fraternity game uh the limp biscuit

Sorry I wasnt in a fraternity

What is that

Oh II I dont think we need to get into Its where guys stand in a circle and mstrbt onto a cracker

And then the last guy eats it

What

 Again I again  I dont really know why he would mention that

Its super gross

Is this why Gavin Belson stopped working with you

Richard No

The important thing is here um my lawyer has actually drafted a partnership agreement

Why dont you all just Essentially uh we all band together and each contribute 20000

We should have more than enough money to mount a challenge against this guys patent

And if we win we dissolve the patent so that he cant do this to anyone else ever again

Because in the end shouldnt it be Mr

Stewart Burke the patent troll who is forced to eat the biscuit

Im pretty sure thats sexual assault

Yeah no one deserves that

I know

That thats all Im saying

Look Im pretty sure its even made up

Like you know like a donkey punch you know

Again what is a donkey punch

 Its uh when guys  Just dont

Dont

Gman you busy at the moment

Very

Im about to set Anton loose on that talking chrome beer coozy

So care to take a breather and help a pal throw a basketball hoop on the old garage

Why would you need help from a scrawny code jockey such as myself

Fine

Im perfectly capable of figuring it out myself

All I need is Ah

May I borrow this hammer to pound in these flamboyant little nails

 Those are screws

 Yeah no I Jared Dunn

Yep just a moment please

I'll transfer you

confidently

Go for Chambers

laughs

Ned

I knew it was you

Hey did that pssy Jared keep you on hold long

I eat that mtherfuckers lunch every day

laughs




    push

No man I literally eat his food

What do you want

Uhuh aint gonna happen

Thats as high as we go hm

Till next time rook

 phone beeps

 normal voice

I mean did you see that

 Hes amazing

 Who

Ed Chambers

He got Pied Piper a great cloud storage rate from Azure and hes got the hookup on a couple of pallets of pamplemousse LaCroix at his words an amazeballs price

Wow

Good job Jared

Well I mean dont congratulate me

Congratulate Ed Chambers

Ed Chambers is you

Well I wish but Gentlemen

You all said that it couldnt be done but it appears as if Sir Richard the NotShort hath now slain the slimy troll

Stu Burke R

Hendricks

I got word that you called

I assume you spoke with my attorney Monsieur Ron Laflamme

Stewart on speaker Yes I did speak to Ron Laflamme

What pray tell did he tell you when he called you

Stewart Well I called him actually to tell him that the eight companies you apparently tried to organize against me have reached out to me preemptively to settle

And because I appreciated that I offered them a very very reasonable rate

 So Richard Hendricks fuck you

 turns off speaker

Okay

Uh yeah

Uhhuh

I understand

So youre firm on that

Well bye then

 So your coalition fucked us

 Yes

So now we have to pay the 20000

Uh not exactly

Because he Stu is saying that since all eight companies have now licensed the patent he has a stronger case against us so um hed actually like mmore money

 How much

 Three hundred thousand dollars

So we just ate the Wheat Thin didnt we

fridge chimes

Oh Im sorry

I didnt see any Wheat Thins

Shall I add them to your shopping list

 Eh sure

 chimes

Dinesh Well lets hope that Melcher doesnt hear about all this

You guys dont need all these lights on do you

Yes we do

Okay

Well that should be fine

We should be fine

Um fine from what

That fridge is putting up a fight so Im gonna have to try something with Anton

Might put a little strain on the wiring thats all

I'll be in the garage

Hey Richard but youre not seriously gonna defend yourself in court right

Well Larry Flynt did it

And Sir Walter Raleigh although he lost and was publicly beheaded

But you could argue that he eventually won in the court of history

I get it

I shouldve settled

Okay

And I didnt

And youre right I will probably lose but Im not going down without a fight

And Ive got all of Monahans discovery from the Hooli case right here so thats something

 sighs

 box clatters

Oh my God

chuckles

This is from high school

These are all my notes from the original build of Pied Piper 1

0 back when it was just some stupid search app for music copyright s

Hold on

Hold on

 circuit breakers clack

 What the fuck

Sorry

Everybody okay

I dont know you fucking maniac

 Are we

 Probably

 Richard

What what are you up to

 keyboard clicking

About six foot two Jared

Looks like I can slay that troll after all

 music playing

 Stewart What am I looking at

Well you said that you used Cancion De Amores to sue musicians claimed that they stole that song right

Bought two houses put Jeremy through four years of college

Six and hes still 20 credits short

Okay well he may want to consider financial aid um because that little song there was itself stolen from an old country song called Im Cryin with My Eyes from 1967 a full eight years before Cancion De Amores

 And Im pretty sure Katrina and the Waves would want to know that they gave you a piece of Walking on Sunshine for nothing

Mazda may want to pull that whole Super Bowl spot

 Bullshit

 No no not bullshit

Computer science

Yeah and we can take it to court if you like see who they believe perhaps the most advanced and sophisticated patternmatching algorithm ever devised by a fucking genius or some old asshole who once sued Stevie Wonder

All right

What do you want you little prick

chuckles

Correction sir

I am a big prick

Hello my cold friend

Hello

Fridge Huh

Suck it JianYang

Mmm

Ah

Huh

Huh

You attack and destroy my refrigerator

And you misspell my name

I did

I had to overclock Anton but I was able to bruteforce the backdoor password to that chrome piece of shit in under 12 hours

And I added a little visual flair

Fridge Huh

Suck it JianYang

  Mmm

Ah

Huh

Richard sighs

Jared So

So he bought it

Hook line and sinker

Yeah he thinks the search results are real

You trolled the troll

Yeah yeah for a second there he wasnt buying it and then I just started babbling on about tech specs until his eyes glazed over

Well as a result we now have a perpetual royaltyfree license for the patent

Yes

See

I stuck to my gns and as a result we now have 20 grand we would have otherwise lost if I had listened to you delicate little snowflakes and settled

Yeah

Twenty grand

Yeah so let me cum into a bucket and have you all drink it

Uh Richard

Could I have a a moment

sighs

Sorry about that

III I regretted it the second it came out of my mouth

Richard

Well yes but  Here

 Whats this

Um that is a bill from Ron Laflamme for the paperwork he had to do to put your coalition of companies together

Twentytwo thousand dollars

Yeah

Its at the high end of standard

So it wouldve cost us slightly less if wed have just Paid the troll

Well thats true but can you put a price on dignity

Apparently I just did

Do me a favor and dont tell the guys

 Yeah

You have my utmost discretion

 Thank you

Um speaking of Richard I need to tell you something

I had to let Ed Chambers go

 Who

 My fictional supervisor

He bragged to a sales rep at LaCroix about doing it to Sonia Sotomayor so Ed is no longer with us

Im sure we can manage

He also was never actually with us

 Right

Out of sight out of mind

 Cause he was never real

 And out of reality

 Yeah well

Oh Ed Chambers

Dont hit No no no no

Oh

 thuds

 groans

fuck

 whistle tweets

 basketball bouncing

Yeah a lot of these guys arent man enough to work for an allfemale led VC firm but not me

I believe that the future is female

And anyone who says otherwise can suck my fat dick

Yo yo yo

Woo
