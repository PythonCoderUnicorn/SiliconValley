This is where it all began gentlemen

The birthplace of Hooli

Peter Gregorys mothers garage

That was Peters workstation

This was mine

Things sure have changed

But in a way theyve stayed exactly the same

As we forge our new path together we must remain focused on whats really important not material success or wealth but this the spirit of innovation a few coders some ramen and a dream

And that is why I brought you here

All right

Let me show you the rest of the place

whirring

Gilfoyle Ah

Youve got a garage inside your garage

Impressive

I'll move you in as soon as construction is complete

Its going to be exquisite

Frank Gehry has really outdone himself

Yeah

Frank is the fucking best

He does all my buildings

Richard Okay guys

Were all set up

Shall we

Yes

Lets do it of course

Richard All right

So in building this peertopeer Internet the paradox that were up against is that people wont want to participate until the quality is high and the quality wont be high until um and the quality wont be high until we have a lot of people opt in to the network so that presents a little bit of aa a unique Continue

Oh

Uh okay

It presents a bit of a problem what with that we kind of need to build Oh

Uh stammers

Richard everything okay

I dont know

Is it

Oh sorry

Guys Bryce

Bryce guys

Uh actually weve met

Oh

Hey Donald

Uh its Jared now

 So Gavin

Bryce is

 machine beeps

 Very discreet

 whirring

Keep going

This is great

Uh is Bryce your assistant

No of course not

Hes my transfusion associate

Which is

Are you really not familiar with parabiosis

Cant say that I am

Well the science is actually pretty fascinating

Regular transfusions of the blood of a younger physically fit donor can significantly retard the aging process

And Bryce is a picture of health

Just look at him

He looks like a nzi propaganda poster

Oh

people chattering

Erlich This is quite the baby shower

I bet you think youre some big swinging dick now that youre getting invited to all these fancy VC soirees

Yes

My dick is very enormous and my app made Raviga a lot of money

And I still pay no rent

Nobody likes a braggart JianYang

Hey guys

Hello

Congratulations

Youre pregnant

Erlich No no no

No she No she No no

Uhuh

clears throat

FYI Monica my invite must have gotten lost in the email but young Jinathin was kind enough to add me as his plusone

Dont look at me

This is all Ed Chens doing

 chattering

 Erlich Is that Aarush Agrawal

 Monica Mmhmm

 I thought he retired

Hes still on the board

What would a cofounder of Raviga be doing at a baby shower

 How often is he even in the building

 Like once a year

Ed Chen threw this whole thing just to suck up to Laurie

Monica this is not a baby shower

This is a coup

What are you talking about

Ed Chen didnt throw this party to impress Laurie

He threw it to oust her

Invite all these misogynistic Aholes who think that pregnancy is a weakness convince them that shes shirking her responsibilities at Raviga

You said it yourself theres more dick in here than a synthetic pssy convention

I didnt say anything close to that

 No

 No

inhales deeply

Regardless Ed Chen and Aarush are broing down

I suggest you get in before you get cut out

You see this guy

Monica Tequila shots at a baby shower

You want me to join the frat house

Unfortunately in this climate Monica  you either bro down or you go down

 Monica

Laurie is also pregnant

JianYang are you drinking creamer

Its halfhalf

Which brings us to our one final crucial question

What value can we offer now to the user to entice them to download the app and opt in to our network

And the answer is the brandnew Pied Piper app

The app will take all of the data on a persons phone and compress it freeing up 20 percent more storage

They can have half of that free memory while we will take the other half walled off on their phone for our own future use

 Its a winwin

 Gavin Mmm

Thats very well thought out

Well done gentlemen

So when do we announce

Announce what

Richard when I do something its news

Dont you think you want to lean into that

Well announce rack up huge user interest and then do a massive public launch at scale

Uh no

We planned this under the assumption that it would be rolling out quietly and not really talking about our ultimate intentions

Besides rolling out at scale is a completely different model with vastly different technical and business challenges

And were not prepared for that

No

I think wed all agree that a a stealth rollout would be best for this one

Mmm

inhales sharply

Gavin Bryce

Did you have a thought

Uh well you know it just seems like a missed opportunity

I mean shouldnt you figure out how a big launch would work before you just say no to it

 Hmm

 Or Or not

You know its not my company

That is so true

You know Richard Bryce makes a good point

Why dont you guys just whip up an alternate launch plan with a big public rollout and then we can compare apples to apples

Gavin allall all due respect

This plan took two weeks to develop

Hard work is the price of greatness so lets get to work

Woo

Well this meeting was just absolutely fucking great

Richard Donald Goldfoil

breathes deeply

Woo

laughs

Go team

Woo

Uh the fuck just happened

 clears throat

Hey Bryce

 Yeah

Wh uh next time youre at a meeting of our company of which you are not a part of in any respect can you please keep your little ideas to yourself

Im Im sorry

Im just Im just trying to be helpful

Richard Well you werent at all

I mean we had him on our side because Id basically just convinced Gavin that a stealth rollout was the best idea

Uh you know well I Its just a stealth rollout doesnt sound like the way to go to me

WhatWhat What are you talking about

I mean Gavin has obviously had a lot more success than you Richard and I just think having an asset like Gavin Belson  on your side  Whatd you say

 You dick

 Whoa

You dick

You dick

 Okay

 Whoa

All right

 fuck you

 Okay

Its okay

 Im sorry

Im sorry

 Its okay

Its okay

This is already the best job I ever had

I dont know what to say

I am so so sorry

I just couldnt let Bryce talk to you like that

 Did I frighten you

 Richard No

fuck him right

And fuck Gavin

I mean what we take his orders now

Hes our boss

Were supposed to be partners you know like equals

Right

And what

Hes taking the advice of that stupid little pretty boy over me

Wait

He has a garage in his garage

And he has a yacht with a pool on it and a pool with a yacht in it

And he has a real live blood boy

What

He has an actual blood boy

Thats real

Yeah hes real

Real mouthy

I mean hes sticking his perfectly symmetrical face into actual smart peoples business

I mean that Ken doll probably thinks traversing a binary search tree runs in the order of n instead of log n  Idiot

Jared called him a dick

Seriously

To his face

No

 Yeah

 Dinesh That sounds awesome

But its probably nothing compared to the thousands upon thousands of gnarled male genitals that you get to see every day at your job

 mutters

fuck

 door opens

 Hey

 Hi

 Brought you some dinner Neshi

 Thank you

 Mia giggles

 Neshi

Shut the fuck up Gilfoyle

You just missed these idiots telling me how hard theyre selling out by working for fucking Galvin Belson in his disgusting lap of luxury

Seriously how can you work for that asshole

My man the Gavin Killer would never compromise his principles for money

Oh no

No he would not

And he is busy doing the rewarding work of keeping the Internet free of graphic sexual imagery

Hey can we eat later

Of course

giggles

Im gonna go put this in the fridge

Okay

Yeah

Thank you

Hey you actually still havent told her  that your takedown of Gavin Belson  Shh

 was an accident

 Dinesh whispers

It hasnt come up

 We were just talking about him  phone plays tune

 with her so it did come up

 Just  Gavin

Hello

 Hey could you Gavin on phone

 Richard did you and a member of your team verbally assault my transfusion associate

Do you have any idea what that kind of stress could do to his cortisol levels

And therefore my cortisol levels

Y Yeah

Well uh hes not technically in the company and he kind of just butted in so Is your ego so fragile that if someone disagrees with you you have to demean them

I want you to go and apologize to Bryce immediately

Why should I apologize

Why should I be in business with someone who treats support staff with such contempt

You can tell a lot about a persons character by how they treat the little people Richard

I bet youre mean to waiters too

guffaws

What

No

Im Im awesome to waiters

Well then I suggest you be awesome to Bryce too

His blood is flowing through my veins Richard

 Make this right

 line clicks

fucking blood boy

knocking

What do you want Richard

Bryce I wanted to swing by and apologize for yelling at you when you offered your very unsolicited opinion

Also on behalf of Jared we mean no disrespect to you or your career choice

Okay

My career choice

You think that I moved out here to be a blood boy

 Did you know I have a degree in CS

 You do

Yeah but you probably thought that I was just you know some dumb jock

Well thats typical because people who look like me we never get taken seriously in the tech business by people who look like you

Youre biased

Whoa

Hang on

I am not biased

Okay

Aw come on

Hey the whole business is biased

I mean thats the only way that a goodlooking guy like me could get in a room with Gavin Belson is by being a blood boy

And that sucks

I I got to work out constantly

I cant have a beer with my friends

I cant eat junk food

Do you know that Gavin made me go full veg

I mean fuck soy man

But to people like you Im just a beautiful bag of blood

But you know what

I got some pretty good fucking ideas and Gavin actually listens to those ideas

It took a while but he respects me

And you know what Richard Hendricks

You clearly fucking dont

 So good night

 W Hey look its Osama Bin fuckin

Thought you were staying at Mias tonight

I was going to but alas I had some intestinal distress so I couldnt stay which really sucks because shes so great which really is horrible because its so hard to be away from her because shes so great

Can I contin I have no diarrhea

I lied

I am so fucked

This girl is gonna kll me  or get me klled

 Do tell

So shes super attractive and shes super smart and shes way into me like way more than a normal person should be

And sx

Theres so much sx

The problem is the part after

When you have to apologize

No

When we do pillow talk

Oh

Thats the best part

Everything before that is just foreplay

Not with her

Shell tell me how cute I am and how into me she is and how she hacked into Bowman Avenue dam

That was the Iranian Revolutionary Guard

No

It was her

She pinned it on them

She flooded an area being surveyed for hotel construction

Just to confirm honesty is off the table right

Because it seems like the longer you wait the the worse its gonna get

Im with Jared

You should wait

I have to end it right now

 First thing Monday

 Mmm

Well Saturday is her sisters wedding

And then Sunday you know Sundays are just for me you guys know that

Wait

Her sisters wedding

 Thats what you should be afraid of

 Why

Gilfoyle Thats a threshold that you dont want to cross

Well I mean weddings are very public events with photographers taking pictures of you  indelibly tied to her

 door opens

Jared Those are forever photos

 Forever

 door closes

slowly

fuck

Hey guys

Im trying to find Erlich

Is he holding

Im afraid you caught me at an inopportune time

Im long overdue to a trip to my dispensary so I dont have much

But I have Bubba Kush Chocolate Thunder Barbara Bush Barbara Streisand Barbara Bush Jr

Yeah this this is plenty

No no

That Thats actually for my astigmatism

 Okay

 stammers

This is in case of emergency only

I'll need it if an earthquake occurs

Okay

Just give me whatever

I dont care

Its not for me

Its for Ed Chen

What are you up to clever girl

Well I took your advice

It wasnt pretty but uh I broed down with him pretty hard

I mean I think I did

Its To be honest I was kind of all over the map

I shotgunned a warm beer and then I acted all blown away when he showed me 40 minutes of snowboarding videos set to Diplo remixes

Good on you

But it worked

Im in

Ed copped to everything and said that as long as I dont say anything to Laurie  I have a seat at the table

 Huh

Wait

Did he say that

Those were his exact words

Youll have a seat if you dont tell Laurie

Yeah

So

Oh dear

That does not bode well for you

 lighter flicks

 What do you mean

Well if Ed Chen is afraid of you saying anything to Laurie then that means that the deal isnt solidified yet

He doesnt have the votes

Unfortunately for you that would mean you may have put your money on the wrong horse

So you mean Laurie still has a chance to survive this coup

Well then why did you say I should bro down with Ed Chen

I say a lot of things Monica

I say a lot of things

Um I know you think Im some sort of crusading badass who built a ticking time bmb and slipped it to Gavin Belson to bring him down as retribution for his wrongdoings

But the truth is because of my gross incompetence during my brief and utterly disgraceful tenure as PiperChat CEO I incurred billions of dollars in COPPA fines by exploiting underage users and was saved only by my own cowardice which led to me throwing up on myself

Anyway I'll show myself out

breathes deeply

Im so proud of you

It took guts for you to tell me this

Oh no no no it didnt actually

Full disclosure I knew all about this

I hacked into your phone the first night we were together when you were in the bathroom

I was in there a while

I was hoping that once I earned your trust youd feel comfortable telling me

 And you finally did

 I did

This may sound crazy but if you hadnt by this weekend I was actually considering disinviting you from my sisters wedding

 both laugh

 No way

But you trusted me with your big secret

So I'll trust you with another of mine

 Oh no you dont have to

You dont

 Shhshh

Shh

whispers

I hacked the elevators at the Freedom Tower

slowly

No

kisses

fucking kll me and send me to the horrors of heaven

Itd be better than this shit

Guys I know this has been a ton of work and we wouldnt have to do it if pretty boy kept his mouth shut and the stealth launch is still clearly the play but now we can show Gavin that we fleshed out both options

And we can still push the spacesaving app and not talk about our new Internet until were ready

 Ahoy gents

 Geary Street

What youre eating health food now

 scoffs

 Can you imagine

laughs

Geary Street Organics is not a health food store

chuckles

Richard you are a stitch

No its my dispensary

I mean they have some edibles there




    push

 Theyre not very healthy

 fucking blood boy

 Hey

 Hey

Uh yeah

I was walking around your hood and I thought Id swing by and we could talk about tech you know cause we both know so much about it

 Cool

 Oh man

II I dont know if you know this but you your eyes are super red right now

Oh yeah

Yeah I have allergies

Really

This time of year

Huh

Uh hey um look w what are doing

Oh just just hanging man

Why

You paranoid

Paranoid

No

You know Bryce I got to be honest Im a little hungry

Do you have anything to eat

Uh just some creatine protein powder soy extract

Well Im kind of looking for something a little bit more sweet

laughs

Oh Bryce

Yeah

That Thats not mine

scoffs

Thats for my guests

My My fat guests

You know the fella who owns the house I live in he buys food like this because when he uses the products he buys at the very same health food store you go to he gets cravings for food just like this

And this stuff is not good for your blood

Geary Street Organics isnt a food store is it

Its a pot dispensary

Isnt it

Ha

I got you Bryce

You fuckin liar

laughs

You said you had a degree in CS

Well bullshit

I checked

Its not Computer Science

Its Calisthenic Studies

 What

What

You listen to me you musclebound handsome Adonis

Tech is reserved for people like me

Okay

The freaks the weirdos the misfits the geeks the dweebs the dorks

Not you

Oh and your days of leeching off Gavin Belson are over

Game over blood boy

You fuckin nerd

Monica Laurie

Look

sighs

I know youve been unhappy with me lately

Correct

Look

Im asking you to trust me on something

Ed Chen has been making moves behind your back with the other partners to try and force you out of Raviga

You are referring to the baby shower ruse

 You knew about that

 Monica this is my fourth child

I am no stranger to these types of machinations

However I have countervailed it with my Your fourth child

Yes

As I was saying I have spoken to our top LPs and lined up enough of them in order to leave Raviga and start a new firm

It struck me as a opportune time to jump ship

Holy shit

Youre a fuckin ninja

No

Even though your disclosure just now had absolutely no actionable value it did reveal tremendous loyalty so all is well now

So youre not mad at me anymore

No Monica

I am a human being just like you like Ed Chen and this

Furthermore a question Monica

Would you care to jump ship with me

You are after all my best friend

What

  church bell ringing

 people chattering

 camera clicks

mutters

Oh fuck

Mia What are you guys doing

Man Hands behind your back now

 guests murmuring

 Mia Get your hands off me

 Oh um I got it

 Man Maam calm down

 Mia You cant do this

 Woman Let her go

Mia I want my lawyer

 And just take the cuffs off

 What is the meaning of this

 Dinesh theyre arresting me

 What

Step back sir

Good people of the FBI I dont know what sorts of things you were told or who told them to you we may never know but I can assure you that this young woman is  grunts

 Mia gasps

knocks

Gavin

Im sorry to drop in on you but I happened to have a very enlightening conversation with your transfusion associate

 So did I

S S Sorry

Come in Richard

Oh wow

Its all broken again

 Mind the glass

 glass crunching

Okay

Hes writing a tellall

Apparently he landed a very lucrative deal to air my dirty laundry over the years

He said it was his only career move left

I told you Richard everything I do is news

But didnt he sign an NDA with you

I mean cant you sue him

That would only prove everything hes saying is true and make it worse

Speaking of I had my blood tested this morning

My cholesterol is through the roof

At this rate I'll be dead by the age of 120

Oh no

That Im so sorry

No

Richard Im sorry

I told you that a big public rollout of our product would be good for the company

The truth is I thought it would be good for me emotionally

to change the narrative that Im a fraud and a failure

Come on Bryce is the fraud

And yet I sat here taking business advice from him

A fucking blood boy

Just look at me

Im a fraud and everyone knows it

And when I fell not one person stood up for me

What does that say

I just think its all over for me now

No its its not over

Look I chose to partner with you

That That says something

You didnt want me

You wanted the patent

If I had just given it to you you wouldve walked out that door and never looked back

fuck it

emotionally

Im done

Done

No

No Gavin youre not youre not done

I mean what about our company

What about the new Internet

I dont know

I dont know

Gavin uh  phone ringing

 clears throat

 Gavin shouts

fuck you God

 glass shatters

What have I done to deserve this

glass shattering

Yes

CJ Cantwell please

door opens

Something you want to share with us Richard

I take it you saw the interview

Belson and Hendricks prepare to launch a Pied Piper product soon

 So much for a stealth rollout

You went along with him after all

TechCrunch and Recode and The Wall Street Journal picked it up as well

Gilfoyle I hate to invoke the Nazarene but Jesus Christ what the fuck Richard

Guys in a world where there is no Gavin Belson yeah the stealth rollout was the best play

But we need his patent and his funding and also we need his brain

I know this is going to be a shitton of work but Gavin is our partner

We need him engaged

I made the call

Well sometimes you have to make compromises

I mean I once slept with the head of an assistedliving facility to get my friend Muriel bumped up the wait list

Am I proud of it

No

Do I regret it

laughing

Im out

Oh my God

Oh

Out of what exactly

My relationship

The wedding got raided

The FBI got an anonymous tip about Mias hacking exploits

Can you believe that

Just my luck

Im home free

You ratted your girlfriend out to the FBI because youre too big of a pssy to break up with her

I'll never tell but yes yes I did

The FBI lady hit me in the face so Mias never going to suspect me

Uh Richard now that Mia and I have parted ways can I come work for you at Gavins

Please please please

Well uh yes Dinesh of course

Uh in fact we just announced so climb aboard

laughs

Awesome

Im going to go call Periscope tell them I quit

Best day ever

No more dick pics

 phone plays tune

 Uh clears throat

Hello Gavin

On the phone he said he was going to go find himself
