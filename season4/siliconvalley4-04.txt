  CRICKETS CHIRPING

KNOCKS

LOCK CLICKING

I know its the middle of the night

I really just need five minutes of your time

Okay

 Holy shit

What happened

 DOOR CLOSES

 I was working through some issues

 GLASS CRUNCHING

Mind the glass

What the fuck is this

Its a license for your peertopeer computer communication patent

Its Its very standard stuff

Essentially in exchange for your patent you would get a royalty and equity in the new company that Im starting up

So if you just uh sign there by the PostIt note and I will take it and leave and you will never see me again

Are you joking

Uh well I guess we could hang out

Richard stop talking

EMOTIONALLY

I was just ousted from my own company a company I built from the ground up

My legacy is in ashes

Oh

Come on I wouldnt I wouldnt say that

Well The Wall Street Journal said that

I lost everything because of something you did and youre here at 300 a

m

asking me for a favor

Really

Youre a mean person Richard

Do you know that

You are a bad guy

No

No no no

I wouldnt say that

I think maybe whats happening is that youre just not understanding the technology Im trying to build here

Oh so now Im stupid too

I know what the technology is Richard

I have a patent on it

What the fuck is a matter with you

So youre not gonna sign it

No Im not gonna sign this

Jesus

Youre a fucking sadist you know that

Youre demented

Im almost tempted to let you have a run at it just to watch you waste your fucking time

This technology did not work when Peter theorized it and it doesnt work now

ItIt um It actually does work now

 It does

 Oh really

When did the laws of physics change

When I exceeded the theoretical limit of compression at TechCrunch

 You were there

 I know I was there

Thank you for bringing up that very painful memory

Okay

Can I Can I just  What

 draw on this

Sure why not

Its shattered just like I am

I read Peters notes all of them and he knew that a peertopeer Internet was possible in the future but he was also basing that on what old desktop computers

He never ever foresaw the ubiquity or power of all of our modernday smartphones

He was also dealing with a completely different Weissman limit

So uh yeah

Yeah

Okay

What is that

Is that number correct

The delta in mean device efficiency

Yeah it is

See eventually over time this will render every server that Hooli operates obsolete which would make Jack Barker shit himself

 Holy shit

 You know what

Actually Im gonna CHUCKLES

Welcome to the future Gavin

Whoa

Oh no

Oh no

 Son of a bitch

 I Im sorry

MONICA Wow Dinesh this frontend design looks great

 Thank you

 Nice work

Whats in that

That is a burrito for the test

 Good to know

 Oh

Let him have it

Gilfoyle thought he was too good to work on SeeFood and now hes about to lose a fortune

Okay

Ready for test

After you milady

Oh this is weird

Mia just texted me Good luck with the demo

 Did any of you guys tell her about this

Your hacker girlfriend wouldnt happen to know the model of our router would she

Yeah actually she complimented your choice

Why didnt you say anything

Why would I tell you she said something nice about you

 Damn it

 BURRITO THUDS

We have to assume shes everywhere

Okay

Its ready

Please God

What would you say if I told you there is an app on the ma Were past that part

Just demo it

Okay

Lets start with a hot dog

PHONE CAMERA CLICKS

CHIMES

 Oh shit

 DINESH LAUGHS

 ERLICH Yes

Oh

 MONICA It works

 ERLICH Motherfuck

 Huzzah

JianYang my beautiful little Asiatic friend Im going to buy you the palapa of your life

We will have 12 posts braided palm leaves

Youll never feel exposed again

Im gonna be rich

fuck you Gilfoyle

 Do pizza

 Yes do pizza

 Yeah

 JARED Do pizza

 Pizza

 PHONE CAMERA CLICKS

BEEPS

MONICA Not hot dog

 Wait

What the fuck

 Huh

Thats thats it

It only does hot dogs

No and not hot dog

  LAUGHING

 Give me that

Give it to me

PHONE CAMERA CLICKS

SIGHS

JianYang

Motherfuck

I gave you the ability to spin gold and instead youve spun pubic hair  with shit in it and gravel and corn  Hold on hold on

JianYangs actually put together a pretty good classifier

You know

I mean the core tech is valid

It just It just needs to be trained

So what he did for hot dogs he needs to repeat for every food in existence

No thats very boring work

Thats scraping the Internet for thousands of food pictures

You can you can hire someone else

We cant because we just spent a big fat stack of cash on little Dinesh over here

And there are other expenses legal marketing operating fees those gddmn AWS charges

fucking Bezos

INHALES DEEPLY

And so we do not have the funds to hire scut workers to do your scraping for you

And thus you will scrape the Internet

You and you alone

Im sorry the time to back out was before you signed the term sheet

Im gonna tell Laurie that this was a smashing success

Go make it one

Erlich was right

You are a white witch

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Oh

RICHARD Good

Yes you are all here

Um I think its probably time we all had a chat

About what

Well Im pretty sure youre all wondering where Ive been

You were gone

Yes I was gone all week

I saw you come out of the shower yesterday

Okay

Well obviously Ive been sleeping here at night but Ive been gone during the day

Pretty sure that shower was in the morning

Thats part of the day Richard

Okay Gilfoyle II Ive been sleeping here at night and then Ive been here for some mornings but Im Ive left the house during the day

We all leave the house during the day Richard

Thats not weird

I went to get coffee this morning

Yeah I went to the dispensary and then Id smoked the weed before I got home so I went back to the dispensary

You know what

I just realized I havent left the house in six days

Now thats worth exploring

RICHARD Okay I get it

Look

Every day this week I have been  CLEARS THROAT

at Gavin Belsons house

 What

Gavin has offered to go into business together

LAUGHS

But look I just came there for the patent and he was the one who wanted to be full partners

LAUGHING

What did you say

We talked about it and we agreed that it would be the best thing to do

Oh good Lord

Richard no

Guys look I have the patent

I also have funding and real genuine insight to the whole thing

Lets not forget here that Gavin is a cofounder of a bajilliondollar tech company

Are you out of your fucking mind

When you don the skin of the beast the man within dies

What is that

Nietzsche

One of the boys at my group home always said that

He died

Youre not pulling Dinesh off SeeFood

And I am not leaving SeeFood to go work for Gavin fucking Belson

 Im not asking you to

 Youre not

Guys do you not remember the last time we talked about us all working with Gavin Belson

Gilfoyle you told me to chortle your balls and everybody else walked out of the room

I know how much you hate him which is exactly why I told Gavin if we were gonna do this thing that you guys wouldnt be coming with

So we have hired a recruiter to find people to replace you guys

Even me

Uh well no

You dont really need to be replaced

True I cant be replaced

Well when you left video chat you did keep the rights to the algorithm so I mean its weird but I guess its really none of our business

Its my fucking business

I now own ten percent Five percent actually

 What

 Ten percent of my half of the company is five percent

But I mean look your shares are gonna be worth a whole lot more than they ever would now with the patent and Gavin being involved so So then were all good here I guess right

I think thats right

Weird

All right

Well thanks for understanding

Uh youre welcome

DOOR CLOSES

I dont think we need to be afraid of the WiFi

Its pronounced wifey and clearly you dont understand the threat level of the person that youre sexually disappointing

Were going hardwire

What about for my phone

You mean the thing that tracks your movement and every interaction you have

Literally your fingerprint

The second youre on WiFi its like youre leaving her alone with your phone

So actually leaving her alone with my phone that would be bad

You fucking idiot

I was in the bathroom

For how long

A while

 MAN LAUGHS

 Really

Whos that

CHATTING LAUGHING

Oh Richards meeting with Brett Saxby

GILFOYLE From Hooli

Formerly

The recruiter sent him over

Hes interviewing him for head of engineering

Why

That guy sucks

Why is Richard in there with Brett Saxby

I mean he was in Gavins inner circle

Is Richard aware of that

Is anyone taking notes

Does Richard even have a pen

 That is so funny

 LAUGHS

Its 1000 a m

Why are they drinking beer

Because he sucks

Did dick say who else he was meeting with

The recruiter sent him a whole big list right there

Gonna be late for class

Ooh hows that going

Oh its okay

Im just a little nervous I might run out of material soon

We already watched the Facebook movie A I  The Net and half of Tron

Which Tron

What

No

Tron

Theres two Trons

Oh shit

Thats awesome

It should get me through another week

Thanks

DOOR OPENS CLOSES

This entire list is a shit show of shitheads

Why would Richard trust a recruiter to source him recruits

It doesnt make sense

 Huh

 What

You guys seem like super invested in who Richard hires to work with Gavin Belson thats all

Are you insinuating jealousy

This is just concern for Richards vision

Mmhmm

If Richard wants to saddle himself with mediocrity go for it

 BOTH LAUGHING

 You did not

I swear to God bro

I swear to God

Well I'll tell you what

Next time you bust out the old SeaDoo give me a call

Good

Guys you know Brett

Nope

Uh its great to meet you guys

Weve met

Uh okay

Well it has been a pleasure

I shall walk you to your car

 All right

Uh After me

 Yeah

 Yeah yeah

 Okay

DOOR OPENS CLOSES

JARED I hate him

Gentlemen I just paid the palapa contractor

The palapa piper so to speak

The dream is a reality

Well no longer be exposed to the elements

Hey Erlich

You wanna guess whos on this list of availables that Richard just got from his recruiter

Who

Your boy JianYang

 What

 What

JianYang

You already have a fucking job JianYang

You have to finish SeeFood

Now get to food scraping

I fucking hate SeeFood

I have to look at different hot dogs

Theres Chinese hot dogs Polish hot dogs Jewish hot dogs

It fucking stupid

Well here

Heres one more for you

PHONE CAMERA CLICKS

See

Hot dog  It doesnt even fucking work right

Then you should hire someone using company money not build a roof over nothing

The palapa was budgeted for JianYang

Thats what you do when you get funding you upscale your workspace to help with recruiting

You just said you recruit no one

Because we spent all the money on upscaling

Why Why is this so confusing

Youre stealing

If you can steal I can quit

I have meetings at Periscope Airbnb

Good companies

EMPHATICALLY

The fuck you do

We still have 150000 of Ravigas money left

Thats three months of burn

So until we are dick up and flat broke this is your life

Get to it

This is no life

I want to live

Erase that dick picture

Youve got mail

KATHLEEN Yes

JOE Those are very powerful words

Sorry

No no

Its okay

Your phone has technology inside it so youre doublelearning

CAR ENGINE REVVING

Tell u one thing and u better not JianYang what in the good fuck is that

Its called business expense

Tired of all these pocket watchers nggs  You buy a hut

 MUSIC STOPS

I buy a car

You say Keep doing SeeFood until money is gone

 Now the money is gone

dick is up

Whered you get those sunglasses

Did they come with the car

These are from your mom

Listen JianYang you cant just blow the rest of our runway on a Corvette

 MUSIC CONTINUES

 SHOUTS

Over there looking at me like mase now Touch and tease me like case now TIRES SCREECH

Just bring it on back when u back around nggs talk worse than bitches So u gotta watch who you kick it wit The fuck was that

Oh just three months of runway being driven off by 90 pounds of asshole

Spoken by a 280pound pile of shit

The fuck are you gonna do now

Professor Bighetti a word if you please

 Richard  DOOR CLOSES

I know its none of my business but I worked with that Brett Saxby fellow at Hooli

Hes a talented engineer but in an office environment he can be both tardy and fresh

Uh Im Im not hiring him

He uses spaces not tabs

I see

Okay

Well thats a relief

But Richard what about the next Brett Saxby

Or the Brett Saxby after that

And even if you vet them all you are still in a room with Gavin

So

Were partners

Whats your point

He and his his posse of of bandits and cutthroats will turn on you in a second

You need me the halfcrazed halfApache who will do anything to get your back

I'll scalp Gavin if I have to and all the rest of those paleface sons of bitches

I'll kll them with knives

I'll kll them with gns

I'll kll them with my hands

I'll talk them into su1c1de

It doesnt matter

All right Jared I I think what youre asking is you want a job

If you think you can find a place for me  Yeah of course Jared

 Yeah

Youre more than welcome to work on this

But just to be clear youre not gonna stab anyone are you

LAUGHING

Oh it feels good to laugh

SIGHS CHUCKLES

So So thats a no then

LAUGHING

Richard




    push

DOOR CLOSES

So were not gonna finish the movie

Yeah sorry but my colleague here was pretty adamant that a better use of class time might be to learn while accomplishing something

Now take one pass it all the way down

Were supposed to scrape the Internet for thousands of food images

Yeah

So youll find like five or 30000 pictures of your food and then put them in a folder with that foods name on it

And its good if you get like weird angles or lighting of your food

So it should be pretty fun

So were gathering training data to run through a convolutional neural net

Like an image classifier

Who wants broccoli

Broccolini for the ladies

Broccoli

Just so you know this does not mean I dont trust her

Im just doing this so youll like shut up and leave me alone

WHISPERS

Mia if youre listening youre so pretty

Oh youre both headed to Gavins

Indeed we are

Together again

Butch Cassidy and his head of business development

RICHARD Oh wow another Western reference

Yaw

LAUGHS

Lets go

DOOR OPENS CLOSES

 You know hed hire you too

 What

All you have to do is admit that you want the job

And like get down on your knees and beg

Says the guy whos romancing a woman through a phone that isnt even on

A woman that he described to me in private as a skinny little fuck factory

Oh no I didnt

God

Mia I would never do that

GAVIN Richard Brett Saxby ran my data analytics team for three years

Respectfully I think passing on him is a mistake

Yes

Well uh I met with Brett Saxby  and um to be honest  THUDS

WORKERS CHATTERING

To be honest I dont I dont think hes our man

Fair enough

There are plenty of good alternatives on this list

Although Im a little confused by your notes on some of these people

David Burnham

Annoying slob fuckedup face

I could write better Python with my asshole

 You know what

I think I think you have my list

Yes I have a very weird shorthand

Yeah

Okay next

Becca Th No guys that goes in the the sunroom

I'll show you

All right

Back in a flash

Come this way gentlemen

Here

God there are pages of graphic insults here

fucking Gilfoyle

Right

Richard would you be open to having Gilfoyle on the team

Well yeah of course

I mean Id hire him in a second but hed never do it

Richard Gilfoyle is a man of intense pride

So when he refers to a potential employee as a pigfaced fuck nose what I hear is I need to be needed

 Well what I hear is pigfaced fuck nose

 Exactly

I mean Gilfoyles insults are normally well crafted almost poetic

Last week he referred to me as Frankensteins bulimic daughter

 Yeah I get what you mean

SCOFFS

So what do you want me to do Jared beg him

Well I I think a little outreach would be in the companys best interest

Really

Buttdick

The mans in pain

Hey I know this system is super confusing but we dont see any completed assignments

Cut the shit

Wheres the work

Well we all got to talking the other day after class

We couldnt figure out if you were like a TA or why you were giving us assignments but we all agreed we didnt like the way that you were speaking to Professor Bighetti

Im used to it

So we searched your name on PitchBook and that SeeFood app you got funded at Raviga popped up

PitchBook

How do you have access to PitchBook

Your idea was so simple

It was like something you could come up with in the room during a meeting

Which is what Garrett from Coleman Blair told us at the CS undergrad mixer on Friday

GARRETT Hey Erlich

Here I am

Class of 06

 Go Cardinal

 Go Cardinal

Anyways we founded our own Shazamforfood company  and hes funding us

 Mmhmm

Whoa congrats

Wait thats stealing

No

Its exactly what Mark Zuckerberg did to the Winkle guy in that Facebook movie Professor Bighetti had us watch

And he was the hero of that film

NICK And with all of us working together well easily beat you to market

So thats how it goes huh

Hmm

You steal a mans idea rendering his company worthless

Ive read a number of disparaging articles about your generation in The Atlantic and Slate

com summaries

Its all true

TRIGGER WARNING fuck you

STUDENTS GASP

Professor Bighetti I'll see you at home

You apologize

In this case yes I apologize

Who am I to advise you on your very valuable company

Its time to let you go like a bird

So go out there without me

Make your recipe app

Take your meetings

 Live

That being said  VIDEO GAME ZAPPING

since theres no cash to buy me out I propose this allow me to keep the palapa and give me the Vette

Youre cashing out

Dinesh stay out of this please

Car and hut for ten percent

Its a palapa

Okay

Its a deal

You know the car was a mistake

I was driving next to a store window and I stop and look in my reflection

I looked like an asshole

Yes Im sure it was just the car

A little piece of advice regarding American culture a Corvette takes a certain sort of man to be able to pull off

Like a fedora

Anyway keys

Oh and now that Im out of the company youll need to tell Monica what transpired

Thank you

Gentlemen Im off to be out and about in the Vette

Be back for supper that is of course unless I get fucked to death by the fairer sx

VIDEO GAME ZAPPING

Gilfoyle Richard would like a moment if you dont mind

GAME PAUSES

Do you guys need me to go somewhere else

No its fine

You can stay

You can hear this

Okay well Gilfoyle I have reviewed the candidates and it is very clear to me that our company cannot succeed without your unrivaled talents as a systems architect

So would you please please please please come work for Pied Piper

Thanks for asking

Im going to put this as delicately as I know how

You can chortle my balls

Okay well so who do we want to run frontend Dev

Cuntass or Fuckjerk

Listen

This thing with Gavin isnt gonna work without me so because I feel bad for you and Id hate to see you fuck up good tech which will happen if Im not there Im willing to help you

Thats a beautiful gesture

So youre back aboard

FYI Becca Thorton is a cancerous prolapsed anus of a human being but as a systems engineer shes not all bad

Laurie

Oh

Yes

Monica come in

I just heard the good news

About

LAURIE JianYangs nimble pivot

Back away from the glass please

Special occasion

He told me the whole story

His interview at Periscope his discovery of a photo of Bachmans genitals on his phone when demonstrating the app and his eureka moment when it turned out that his not hot dog technology outperformed Periscopes own technology

He said all that

Not quickly

The eventual point JianYang unwittingly crafted an amazing tool for the realtime detection and filtering of penile imagery

And Periscope does have a dick problem

Monica

SCOFFS

JianYang went to Periscope for a job and walked out with a 4million acquisition offer

Given our liquidation preference we have 10 Xed in two weeks so hats off Well thank you so much

to Ed Chen for his shrewd call both to invest in this and make you lead

He is quite astute which is why we have promoted him to senior partner

MUTTERS

Yeah

CELL PHONE RINGS BEEPS

Monica youve got Erlich

Im here with JianYang and he just told me that you traded ten percent of the company for a used car and a A hut

Monica ON PHONE A hut

A palapa and so what

What do you mean its a halfamilliondollar palapa

JianYing ON PHONE Erlich is the refrigerator running

This is Mike Hunt and hes rich

Shit

Oh hey when you begged Richard for the job did you actually like literally lick his boots or did you just go like MOCKINGLY

Pretty please Richard

Please can I have a job Richard Whatever I did it was worth it for the chance to work without you

Speaking of did your deal with Periscope ever close

Yep

If I stay a year I vest a big chunk of Twitter stock

 Great

 Great

And what exactly are you working on

Oh you know were tuning our algorithm

Were reconfiguring our classifier from food to another purpose

Uhhuh

In other words you sit around and look at dick pics all day long

Dont let me stop you

Wow

 KEYBOARD CLICKS

 I would say Not safe for work but this is your work for a year at least
