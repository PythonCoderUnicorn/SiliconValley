 man shouting

 woman shrieks

Oh

You only make that face when your dick is on fire

So youre certain

Definitively

The 36 HooliPhones that blew up at Hoolicon and the 17 that blew up around the US all had our code on them

Richard these are real people with real crotches and theyre burning

We have to tell someone

This was our fault

No

No no

Keenans demo was built to run on a 10000 rig

Jack ported it to a phone in four days

They wrote sloppy code thats pinging the antenna constantly looking for the goggles

That had to have caused the phones antenna to draw too much power Which would overheat the subpar battery

And when we pinged our network on top of all that  dick fire

 Richard what happened to being Honest Abe from now on

We committed a crime here

 Barely Jared

 The fact that we hacked those phones works in our favor

All of our code is hidden

Agreed

And when Hooli launches a new software update to fix the phones our network will still be functional Melcher will be happy Monica will fund us and no one will ever know what we did

 I'll know

 Yes

I'll know too but Im okay with it

Im sorry

rustling

What the fuck is this

I write three letters every time I start a job a personal action plan a letter to my 40yearold self and that a resignation letter

Uh I'll be moving my things back into my condo

 What about your squatter

 Oh hes been out for months

He left to go sell coca1ne at the Keystone Pipeline protests

Ive just been staying in the garage out of solidarity

You cant leave

 Dont beg Richard

 Im not

According to the employee handbook which you wrote an employee cannot leave without giving two weeks notice

You you read the handbook

 Yeah I did

 All right fine

I'll fulfill my duties under protest but I will not do anything illegal nor unethical and I will not lie

I already have upwards of 50 burnt perinea on my conscience

Richard thats enough

Consider that my two weeks notice

 door opens

 All right

Keep an eye on HooliNews and let me know when Jack announces the HooliPhone update

What do you mean youre not issuing a software update

Who can say why the phone Gavin Belson brought to market started exploding when we put Keenan Feldspars technology on it

Huh

Is it Gavins fault

Is it Keenans fault

Is it 5050

Who knows

We need to change the narrative here

Has anyone flown commercial recently

Nor have I but apparently theyre still making the announcements at the gate about Samsung Galaxy Note 7 being banned

We cant have people believing that our phones blow up airplanes no matter how much Gavin andor Keenan may have wanted it

Its lethal PR

We need to get ahead of this one which is why I am going to pull every last affected HooliPhone out of circulation and replace it in the next three days

Thats over nine million devices

Gavin Belson had to move heaven and earth to get our China plants up to a capacity of two million per day and his negotiations with labor were extremely delicate

Well China has never negotiated with Jack Barker

What youre proposing is staggeringly expensive and borderline impossible

We wont approve it

I see

Uh Slight hitch

I may have instructed my comms team to issue a press release announcing the recall and it should be going out at  Yeah its out

 Jack

I'll tell you what lets just gas up that HooliJet and I am going to go ahead and go to China

theme music playing

So every fucking HooliPhone that were on is being pulled out of service and replaced with a new one that doesnt have our code on it

Half of our storage capacity just gone

Where the fuck are we gonna put all of Melchers data

Wait

We have a server farm in the garage right

Now dont you think if Anton couldve saved our ass I wouldve suggested it by now

 Why cant it work

 What are you fucking stupid

In order to hold that much data we would have to go RAID zero no backup so if we lose even one platter we lose Melchers data permanently

Plus in Antons present condition Im afraid he might totally melt down

 We have to call Melcher

 No we are not calling Melcher

If we tell him about any of this that would be su1c1de

Look if were gonna die lets just die

Why do we have to take Anton with us

Jesus man

You know that things not alive right

 fuck your dumb machine

 Wait

Do you

Do you actually fuck your dumb machine

 Is that the secret on your phone

 fuck you

 fuck you

Do you rawdog it

 Guys

Guys

Guys

Or do you put a condom on your tiny pen1s and fuck it in safe mode

Just fuck each other and get it over with

Oh Anton fuck me  I will fuck both of you  Dinesh shouting

 Gentlemen

This is Gladys

 Gilfoyle fuck you

Shes interviewing to be my replacement

Gilfoyle Anton is going to be fine okay

Just spin him up

Please

 whirring

 Lets see what youre made of

Outstanding

Im sorry that you had to witness that scene in there

It probably gave you the impression that the company is in disarray but I can assure you theres a very simple explanation for that

 It it is

 Sorry

Yeah even setting aside our CEOs sexual distortion adultery and lowbrow scatlogical vandalism were still essentially a a criminal operation whose only real product is dangerous malware

I see youre fluent in Japanese

Are are you gonna be comfortable with casual racism

Im sorry

What happened here

Uh arson

distant monks chanting

 whispering

Hsst

Gavin

Were about to fry three of our platters

I said this was a bad idea

What are we gonna do

Excuse me

Just FYI Gladys turned us down

Oh hey Richard long time no talk

Yeah weve all been busy so

 Oh yeah

Oh jeez

Uh I dont think I can do that man

Sure you can man

Just click on Forgot password

 No um itit its just um Im kinda on superthin ice with the head of the CS department right now

After Erlichs whole SeeFood thing Standford started looking into my academic background realized that I dont really have one and now Im on probation and theyve got this real teacher sitting in watching me

That is that is a bummer

But hey Big Head they do um genome sequence analysis on the Sherlock cluster

Theyre not gonna notice a few more measly petabytes all right

Well just get on and get off before anyone even notices were there

Yeah

Come on man

I need this all right

I wouldnt ask you otherwise

All right

My username is password and my password is password

 Your username is password

It was just easier

Okay Big Head came through

Ive already reserved the resources

We can start the transfer whenever were ready

Slight problem

I cant get online

What the fuck

I cant get on either

Gilfoyle did you fry the fucking router again

No

Jared

Did you pay the broadband bill

No

I mean we dont have the funds

 What

 I tried to bring it to your attention but you said fuck off Mom

 Wait

Are you telling me Anton is completely cut off from the outside world

Which means Melchers data is offline

Were in breach

Shit

Okay uh you guys keep Anton alive

I will figure something out

A product recall on that scale

What the fuck is Barker thinking

Uh I was only at eight percent so if you could close some applications

Monk Cell phone

Lamala I I need to know what Hooli stock is doing

You must choose

Erlich get the bags

 Dan mumbles

 Thats insane

 Okay well unless you happen to have a threemile long Ethernet cable hidden up your fucking asshole thats the plan

I dont feel the slightest bit more spiritually centered

Can this thing go any faster

 Richard

 Oh

Yeah

Okay

Thank you Jared

Uh so what what time did Big Head say he needed us there

I dont know

He said whenever

Typically campus security requires a specific window  for deliveries of this size

 Okay

Did you send him an inventory so that he could request and clear a static IP address for each server

No

No

I wouldnt worry about it

Maybe I'll just give him a call

Nah its fine

How

With a little system I like to call the conjoined triangles of success

Thats very gracious of you Jack

Thank you

Woman Welcome aboard gentlemen

Our flying time to Mountain View is 11 hours and 36 minutes and we will be stopping off in Jackson Hole first

Oh

Stopping off at Jackson Hole are you Gavin

 chuckles

 No Jack

You are

Jackson Hole is definitively out of the way

Everyone knows that

But I dont mind dropping you off first this one last time

elevator dings

office phone rings

Hey

What are you guys doing here

Jared called us

If youre gonna eat a giant plate of steaming hot shit we figured it should probably be a team effort

people chattering

Okay

Thanks

Uh I'll go check in

Hi could you tell Dan Melcher that Richard Hendricks and the guys from Pied Piper are here to see him

You guys are Pied Piper

The guys who built our data storage network

Its awesome

Oh

yeah it was awesome until it crashed this morning

I was just using it two minutes ago

Its working fine

 Really

 Man Yeah

Uh whats he talking about

 beeps

 Richard Its up

All of Melchers data is there

How is that possible

What are those devices

Those arent phones

laughing creepily

whispers

Why the fuck are you laughing

You look fucking insane right now

Look at that OUI prefixes in these MAC addresses

Yeah okay so what are those

Smart fridges

About 30000 of them

Come again

JianYangs smart fridge must have been selfcorrecting

In order to fit my Suck it JianYang video onto his fridge I had to add Pied Piper libraries to the firmware

Other smart fridges mustve seen this as an update

 What

 The smart fridges talk to each other and they share the new software

Right so when we put that data onto Anton the last thing he did before he died was back himself up onto a huge network of smart fridges

Anton died so we could live

Like Jesus

Oh fuck

laughs

Guys do you realize what just happened

Were still alive

The network is stable

 Gilfoyle Mmhmm

 The new Internet works and this is the proof

 We did it

 Richard Yes we did

Wait a minute

If Melcher never lost access to his data whats he so upset about

Richard

Richard

Im so sorry

We were tasting cakes and then you called  and then it just came out

 What came out

 You son of a bitch

 Save yourself

screams

 punches thudding

 Im guessing theres a story here

 Jared Stand down

No no no

 Dan Thats it

Help

 Gavin

 Mmm

I like your hair

I like your eye

Yeah I I got it from a woman

She didnt hit me

No the man did because of sex that I gave to her

So welcome home and congratulations on getting your business back

Thank you

And I should congratulate you on your remarkable tech breakthrough

I hear youre swimming in funding offers

A few

I think were gonna go with BreamHall

 They seem to get us

 You havent seen all the offers yet

Richard we were partners once

Id like to do it again

This is an acquisition offer and it will make you a very wealthy man

Lets do this together

Thats very kind of you

 But  Richard at least look it over

I can help you get exactly where you want to go

Im pretty sure I know where I want to go and how to get there

If you reject me now Richard I will come after you

I'll devour you

Think very carefully about what youre doing here

Heres what I think Gavin

I think my decentralized Internet threatens Hoolis box business model

I think basically you are just a server company now and we intend to make servers obsolete

So I think perhaps in the end I will be the one devouring you

I gave you that patent

Thanks

sighs

Fair enough Richard

I shall look forward to the fight

chuckles

Right back at you Gavy baby

Gavin

Oh um did Erlich ever show up in Tibet

No

Jesus

What the hell did he order
