So as you can see since I became the CEO our user growth undeniable

Our retention so sticky its pornographic

 RICHARD Sorry

Sorry

Dinesh I think you accidentally disabled my access keys for the video chat data repository

No actually I deleted them on purpose

I purged all our exemployees

Gleb Sanjay Elisabet you

Gleb

What youre comparing me to Gleb

When we agreed to split the company we said that you could take the algorithm for your video chat and I could use the data flowing through the system to optimize the algorithm for my thing

 We had a deal

 We had an agreement not technically a deal

What the fuck Dinesh

 Play

Play

Blue blue

 Always blue

Always blue

Have fun youre having a party

You got pizza and everything

Always blue

So what

I shouldve got it in writing Dinesh

Is that it

You wanna lawyer up now

You know were just some guys in a house

But I dont wanna be just guys in a house Richard

Thats the whole point

I want PiperChat to be a real company

And after all the bullshit we went through no offense I finally got some real financing lined up for us

I cannot have another Intersite on my hands

That was fucking Russ and his shitty tequila

You know that man

You were there

That wasnt me

Richard it happened on your watch

Im sorry

I really am

But the answer is no

Okay well suck a dick

Im sorry what did you say

 Nice blazer

 Thank you

 Whered you get it

 Does it matter

I just want to know where I can get one so I can look like a total fucking douchebag

Wow right

Unbelievable

Gents why dont we take this party outside

JARED Yes we live in California

We should take advantage of it

Oh Okay

Gavin you told me to interrupt if Jack Barker came to see you

Im sorry

Yes

Send him in

I thought Barker would crack after one day in that basement

The fact that its taken him two weeks to fess up about hijacking my fucking plane and resign will make it all the sweeter

Hiya Skipper

Sorry to barge in

I owe you an apology

Really

Whatever for

When you stuck me in that basement I was like Jack what the hell did you do wrong And Im sorry that it took me so long to get it through my thick skull

I finally figured out what this is all about

Well Im glad to hear it

You are doing exactly what Bobby Iger does over at Disney

What

He makes every manager spend one day of the year in the Goofy suit

Because sometimes you just gotta be at product level to be able to see the best path forward

And once I realized that it was like kapow

It was so obvious

Its the algorithm

Pied Piper put middleout in their vid chat and its amazing now I know

Im on it all the time with my grandkids

We could use middleout to revamp our entire suite of products

We can make billions Chief

Im whipping up some proposals right now that are gonna knock that wig right off your head

Yeah

What the fuck is he up to

Look like a fucking wig to you

The point is JianYang you dont set pitches

I handle the scheduling

Thats the symbiosis of our relationship

 No

 What do you mean no

No

JianYang PiperChat has some real heat okay

And we can draft off of that but it has to be a carefully choreographed dance

You cant just wiggle your little tush and expect every VC in the Valley to get hardson

I am your lead investor you will respect me as such

I do not respect you

Youre not any kind of investor

You own nothing

I own 10 percent

You live in my incubator

No you evict me  I evict your 10 percent

 What are you talking about

Santa Clara Sheriffs Department

Vacate or be forcibly removed

 To be fair JianYang I filed this when I had no expectations  that the system would work

 Okay

JianYang just tell me can you just tell me what the idea is so I can Gauge how aggressively I should pursue it

Hey Jared you were there right

When we split the company into two  Dinesh and I had a very  Stop stop

Please stop

 Richard whatre you doing

 What

What

What do you mean

Im complaining about Dinesh

He He sucks

Hes my boss now Richard

Well your boss is being a real prick

Richard we have to bifurcate our relationship

You and I can no longer discuss business

All right

We can We can talk about anything else two guys might talk about

We can talk about sports teams and their scores or pssy but but you and I cannot and will not discuss business

SIGHS

Hey man for what its worth I thought it was super fucked up what Dinesh did

I know what its like to be the one guy not in the company

You know

So If you want my login its all yours

Really

 Yeah man

 Thanks

You know what

SIGHS

I shouldnt do this

Dinesh said no

And also these are Skyrim cheat codes

Oh shit

Yeah

DINESH Hey my Bloomberg interview is on

How did I come up with PiperChat

Thats a very good question

I guess the tech gods were just speaking through me

Somehow I knew to take the best parts of a service as substandard and crappy as HooliChat and make it INHALES SHARPLY

How do I put this

Incredible

Do you think I have too much product in my hair

No I think you should use more

Wait

Are you saying that because you think I look ridiculous and you want me to look more ridiculous next time

Which answer will get more of that stuff in your hair

Dinesh ON TV but lets just say Wait wait wait

Watch this

This is where I make Emily Chang laugh

Quite a turnaround for a company that wasnt exactly soaring

Oh it was soaring Emily right into a clogged toilet

And not just like a standard clogged toilet

Like I dont need a plunger

I need a shovel and a bucket

But enough about the previous leadership which was inept lame bitter   fuck him

We had a deal

Thanks

MOUSE CLICKING

Thats weird

KNOCKS ON DOOR

Hey Richard

Have you seen the new Sports I'llustrated swimsuit edition

The cover model has the most lovely enigmatic facial expression

Jared I I dont really want to talk about guy talk

Im here to tell you that I think Dinesh may be in some serious trouble

Okay so I was analyzing a bunch of user data and I noticed No no no no no no no

Richard

Richard

I told you I cant talk about this

You have to bifurcate

No Jared listen youre gonna wanna hear this

Wait

What do you mean you were looking at user data

You violated our system

Richard you were inside us

Dont tell Dinesh and dont tell any of the other guys okay

Dont tell Dinesh

Richard Dinesh is my CEO

 Oh God

 What are you doing to me

 Did I make you angry

 GROANS

Im trying to save his ass okay

Im trying to save you

Just survey the users and make sure you ask how old they are

Okay

And then thats it

Thats it

Thats it

No more

DOOR CLOSES

Stupid fucking JianYang and his shitty app

I dont even know if it is shitty

Hey you know I could probably find out about JianYangs app

He asked if he could practicepitch it to me

 Do you have any nines

 Go fish

Wait

This could be great

What time are you guys doing that

 I could listen in

 I dont know

He asked if he could pitch me and I said sure and then he kind of just like kept talking for a while

Oh

You dont think that couldve been the pitch do you

God damn it what did he say

Geez I kind of zoned out

Shit

Fives

Uh go fish

Wait

I dont know if this would be relevant but he did say the word Oculus a whole bunch

 Wait

Oculus

 Mmhmm

Oh my God

Its a VR play

Thats the frothiest space in the Valley right now

Nobody understands it but everybody wants in

Any idiot can walk into a fucking room utter the letters V and R and VCs will hurl bricks of cash at him

Then by the time they find out that its vaporware its too late

I have got to get in on this

Trust me

Just give me five minutes

There he is

 Hey

 Wait

Is that our lawyer

 Hey

 I thought he was in jail

Hey

Perfect timing

I just completed the detailing on this Kia

 Come on

 What the fuck is going on

Wait

I dont understand

How did Richard have access to our user data

Someone mustve let him in

It was you

Youre a fucking rat Jared

Richard entered us without consent

In spite of that he has raised a real issue here

fuck this

Im gonna Uber home

Mr

Monahan good luck with this whole workrelease situation but I have more important things to do

Mr

Chugtai

It appears that 33 percent of your users are under the age of 13

Its also apparent that you have no parental permission requirements in place

Youre going to want to sit down for this

 Are you familiar with COPPA

 Who

Thats the Childrens Online Privacy and Protection Act

This Act establishes strict guidelines to protect the privacy of younger children on the Internet

You are in gross violation of this act

You know how kids cant have a YouTube or Facebook account till theyre 13

Its because of this

Yes but our users are chatting with each other Jared not some old creep

 No offense

 None taken

My shame will linger even after my voting rights are restored

Now are there records of these chats on your server

Yeah we store everything

What Okay

Whats going on

How serious is this

Each violation of COPPA carries a penalty of 16000

So were fined 16000

Oh no

I hope they take cash

16000 per user

Not only each user each use

Fiftyone thousand estimated underage users times an average 25

6 chat sessions per user times 16000 21 billion

POPPING

I mean how is that even fucking possible

POPS

I mean I knew Dinesh was going to fuck this all up but honestly this couldnt get any better

POPPING CONTINUES

Whats with the shirt

Oh he sort of became ill on himself

I was wrong

This just got better

This is all your fault Richard

This was your company before it was mine

What are you talking about

Dinesh I specifically reminded you to port over the terms of service from the platform

Right and I asked if youd done it and and you said you had

Okay

I checked the TOS box when I submitted to the app store but then I didnt end up doing it all right

And then when we caught fire the last thing I wanted to do was bog our users down with legal bullshit you know

I mean nobody reads that stuff anyway

Well first of all everyone reads the terms of service and secondly they wouldve given us legal cover from exactly this

 POPPING QUICKLY

 Every sound is 16000

fuck

All right all right

Dont think about that

Just think about how to solve this massive massive problem

 POPPING CONTINUES

 Quickly

Quick as you can

Jared

Just  Wait

We could shut down

 ERLICH COUGHING




    push

No no no

Not when were this close to signing a term sheet

And in case all of you gents have forgotten Im on the hook for half a million clambos for this thing

But we cant stay online

Were just racking up more fines

Well technically this is a corporation

So whatever they fine you theyll really only be able to collect what the companys worth which at this point is basically nothing

Thats right

Im just the CEO

Im not personally liable

Although  Although what

 POPPING QUICKLY

Well when you lied to me about adding terms of service it could be argued you violated your fiduciary duty to the company rendering you personally liable

I mean if the FTC brought us to trial I could be compelled to testify against you

Jared I trusted you

Oh trust has nothing to do with it but thanks for making that official

So I could be personally liable for 21 billion

Yeah most likely

I know in the fable Pied Piper led all the children into darkness but now were doing it

So what do you wanna do

 POPPING QUICKLY

 GAGS

STRAINED

Im gonna throw up again

Im going to watch this

GAVIN I want full surveillance on Jack Barker 247

HOOVER I dont recommend using conventional listening devices

He may sweep for those

I do have a colleague at Facebook that has a laser microphone

You can point it at an office window from a mile away and read the sound vibrations

I like it

Hoover youre the only person I can trust at this gddmn company

Its good to have a friend

I understand that sir

Ah

Gavin there you are

Oh

I dont want to interrupt your talking with Hoover and talking and talking about things but I have some concrete news

 Regarding

 Jack Barker

By forgoing Western gadgetry simply stationing myself in the hall outside of his office I was able to overhear him speaking of his plans to move against you

He even referred to you as Gavin Smellson

 I knew it

Good work Denpok

Good work

Lets go slice this bstrd in half huh

Hold on

We need proof

Otherwise hell just deny it and it'll just be a case of he saidshe said

Thats a good point

Denpok who was he talking to

Oh um Alas I could not see this from my hidden vantage point

I'll check the logs and see who was in his office

No because no one was there

Im confused

Was he on the phone

Yes

Very perceptive

Easy

I'll just pull up his phone records

No

Not the phone phone

So what was he doing

Was he video chatting

Thats what it was chela

Even better

I'll pull up the chat data

You can do that

Well as long as he was on HooliChat but the bstrd kept grinding in my face how much he loved PiperChat

 What if he was using  PiperChat

Yes

 fuck

 He said the resolution was so vivid and superior to HooliChat

Ah

Sadly now well never know the identity of the person with whom he was definitely talking

 Unless  Unless what

CLATTERS

RICHARD Dinesh

Hey man

Hows it going

Bad

Well look Ive been there man

 No you havent

 No I I have

One time when we were pitching at Ross Loma I threw up in my pants

CHUCKLES

Dont you mean on

No

No I mean I mean in

 We were pitching and well things werent really going well I was getting nervous and I dont know I think I mustve eaten something bad that day

Anyway my stomach was upside down so I made a beeline to the stall

But then I pulled down my pants sat down but instead of shit I threw up into my pants

Well I was CEO for 11 days and in that time I violated the rights of 50000 little girls exposed them to sexual predators and racked up fines the size of a small nations GDP

Yeah

I threw up in my pants

CHUCKLES

fuck

What do I do Richard

There are no right answers

SIGHS

You know when I was CEO I found that it was more about choosing the one wrong answer that you can live with

I really loved that video chat

CELL PHONE BUZZES

Hello

This is he

What

WHISPERS

Its Gavin Belson

Its Gavin fucking Belson

NORMAL VOICE

Hey Gavin Belson

Whats up

Oh my God

Were crushing it all the time

Im in a bathtub

CHUCKLES

Yeah of course

Id love to

Bye

He wants to meet me at Josephinas tonight

Did I say yes

SCOFFS

Holy shit

Gavin Belson wants to acquire PiperChat

He made the same call to me back when he wanted to make an offer for Pied Piper

He could take this entire shitbomb off Dineshs hands

Wheres the fun in that

More importantly I could get all my money back maybe even more

We could 10X this mtherfucker gents

 Although  Although what

Well Im sorry to play the Cassandra again but Dinesh cant sell Gavin the company

 Why not

 Why the fuck not

Its due diligence

Gavin doesnt trust anyone

When I worked for him he tried to microchip me

Before he finalized any acquisition his legal team would uncover our malfeasance

Theyd sniff out the user issue immediately

And theyd probably turn you in and you do not want that

I mean theres also the moral quandary

Even if he could get away with it could Dinesh really sell the company knowing its basically a Sizzler buffet for the sexually deranged

Of course he could

Because even if there is a one percent chance of success and a 99 percent chance of failure and prison he will do the right thing and get me my money back

Im sorry Erlich

Ive made my decision

Im gonna say no to Gavin Belson shut it down and just see what happens

SHOUTS

What the fuck huh

What the fuck

JianYang

Hey Gavin

 Well  Dinesh

Thanks for coming

Listen Gavin

Ive thought about it and if this is about you buying PiperChat I didnt come here today to buy your company

You didnt

No

I came to take it

I thought Id have to buy you out and I wanted to know what kind of CEO Id be dealing with so I had my comms people pull your press like this interview you did with TechCrunch where you described PiperChat as and I quote Exactly like HooliChat but without the suckass parts end quote

Or the one you did with Emily Chang where you told her how you took the best parts of HooliChat and made them less crappy

 I was about to throw you a massive acquisition deal and then I realized youd already publicly admitted to stealing my IP

I hope you have a good lawyer

He works at the car wash down the street

What

Look Gavin you do not want to do this

 I cant explain exactly why

 Shut up

This is not a negotiation

If you fight me I will win and I will fuck you in the tech business forever

No one will hire you

Im taking PiperChat

By 800 a

m

tomorrow you will hand over to Hooli all your data and systems

All your users will be converted to HooliChat users

It will be like PiperChat never existed

And what you get out of it is the chance to walk away and try and get another job in this town

You have five seconds to decide

 Five four  Okay

So were in agreement

For a 10 percent stake in your current venture you will receive full pool privileges more room in the crisper and you may live in my home for For free

for free for six months

fuck you

One year

Fine

Fine

 Its a deal

 Deal

Jian I mean your onerous terms not withstanding Im very excited to be a part of your VR play

 DOOR OPENS

 What

Uh Gavin Im Im sorry

I need to talk to you about this PiperChat acquisition

I put together a panel of the most active users you ported over from PiperChat

Bear in mind this group is representative in terms of gender race and most importantly age

Now who else thinks changing to a HooliChat login is hella lame

Madison Allison Jennifer Stephanie Quinn Ingrid Kaylee  Oh no

 Amber Sarah Janelle Carl
