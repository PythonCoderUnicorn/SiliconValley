You know what

Should we  fuck yeah

 Yeah

Yeah

Uh yeah I guess just put it in the garage

Oh

Uh where I sleep

Yeah its just its the only place with room

Okay

Uh well its good to face your fears

I was scared of intruders till I had one of those in my room and then I realized you know if theyre gonna kll me theyre gonna kll me

chuckles

Cause he kept whispering that

All right

door opens

vehicle approaching

 music playing on speakers

 engine revs

Yeah I alone love you  music stops

 engine stops

 Hey Russ

 Hey Russ

 fuck you Richard Hendricks

 fuck me regarding

Its all over the blogs

You took our idea to Gavin Belson

Whoa

Im sorry

Our idea

Yeah the new Internet

We came up with that together standing outside of my kids school former school

Uh no um you told me to name an idea and so I named one

That was my idea you were just standing there

Yeah pulling it out of you like a newborn baby

Okay but well if a doctor pulls a baby out of a pregnant woman the doctor doesnt get to then keep the baby

Okay first of all my exwife is fucking the doctor that delivered my son and theyre suing for full custody so youre wrong

Second of all this isnt a baby

Stop trying to change the subject Richard

Okay well uh I had to go to Gavin because he owned the patent which as it turns out he just signed over to me

So um its actually good that youre here because you want in and we need funding especially since no VC in town will touch us not even Monicas new firm

So Gavin pulls out and you want me to be your sloppy seconds

scoffs

Its always about my money isnt it

Uh well you are an investor so what else would it be about

 My idea

 It was my idea

Well then fund it yourself

fuck you Richard Hendricks

fuck you right in your little asshole and not in the beautiful way like Grandpa and Pedro

 door closes

 Uh what the hell was that

That was the last wealthy guy in Silicon Valley that would even fucking talk to us

Maybe I'll give him a day to cool off try him again tomorrow or something

Not so sure about that

whizzing

 Richard Oh come on

 Paybacks a bitch isnt it Richard

Woohoo

I dont think he knows thats not your car

Real estate listings

What are you looking to move out

No Im just taking a little Redfin holiday

I find theres a certain escapist allure to real estate listings

I like that one

Too bad its 10 times what I can afford cause you know I quit Periscope to go work for a company with zero prospects cause fuck me

Well with preconstruction pricing this ones actually only six times more than you could afford

So now lets go into Amazon  and see what we could buy  keyboard clicking

with all those imaginary savings

Richard Wait a minute

What if we dont need an investor at all

fuck all these VCs

What if all we need is a customer

Customer for what

We havent built the product yet

Well uh neither have all those condo builders right

I mean they are offering a discount to people who buy before they build

We can do the same thing but with data storage

That sounds like a scam

Well no its actually common practice

Its how I bought my condo

The scam came after when I rented to a squatter who wouldnt leave

Granted theres no shortage of huge corporations with vast amounts of data but its highly risky

I mean Richard wed be offering to store data on a network of cellphones before we built the app or the network

Yeah but look look its no more risky than working with all these crazy billionaires

I mean Jack and his boxes

Gavin just fucked off to go find himself who knows where

Peter died

Yeah I guess that makes him crazy

The point is if you dont draw the line in the sand when some guy pisses in your car where do you you know

Did someone piss in someones car

 clears throat

 Not literally no

Its a uh  clears throat

 Its a figure of speech an old one

Ah an adage

Anyway uh Jared lets get a deck together on this

Aye aye Captain

And uh just word to the wise often the first customer is the hardest one to land

Wait

Customer

Are we pitching

 Yeah looks like it

 Hot damn Richie

Lets hit the road

Were gonna piss in everyones car

Am I using that right

Medical groups sales groups insurance companies Jared yeah good work here really

Well Gavin was right

His name certainly opened a lot of doors

Ever since your announcement everyone has heard of us

Jared you didnt tell all these people that Gavin was still working with the company did you

Well no but I I never explicitly said that he wasnt

 Was that wrong

 Richard No Jared thats fine

The tech will speak for itself

It certainly will

Now Richard when we get into that room let me do all the talking

And also the tech will talk

Wait

So Gavins not coming

No but we are

 Weve already come

 chuckles

Huh

Gavin left the company

Yes um but whats important at least we think is not whether Gavin is gone but what brought him to us in the first place and thats the tech

Uhhuh

Gentlemen sorry to keep you waiting

Im George Mandechian CEO

 Im very excited to  whispers

He did

When

Okay

inhales sharply

God damn it

I mean if people would just look at what were offering I think theyd be blown away

Perhaps we need a new angle

 I'll fake a seizure

 What

Pied Piper

Hi

Im Liz Tinsdale head of compliance here at Fiduciated General

 Erlich Bachman

 And Im uh Richard Hendricks

 Are we all here

 Yes yeah we are

Uh sorry full disclosure uh Gavin Belson has left the company

Oh

Oh I see

Well His loss

He wont be sitting across from someone as charming as yourself this afternoon will he

Okay

Well I mean you did come all the way here so why dont you follow me

Id follow you to the end of the Earth

Shall we

 quietly

What are you doing hmm

 What

Richard So as you can see your data will be even more secure because it will be stored on multiple devices

And we can offer you a very competitive rate

You can expect to see storage savings annually of 25 percent

Wow

Thats very impressive all of it but you guys have to understand that companies like ours are particularly risk averse

Is it a slight Idaho accent Liz

Oh

Its Montana actually

 Even better

The big blue sky state

 Yeah

Well I knew you had to have come from above

Richard Well uh speaking of heaven thats probably where youll think you are when you start saving 25 percent on your data storage

 laughing

 Richard Get an upgrade from there

Liz you have beautiful skin

 Um thank thank you

 Richard You uh yeah

 Both of you

 inhales sharply

Listen uh I think I know what hes gonna say but let me see if I can pull my CTO in here

Can you reel it in a little

Were trying to make a business deal not get you laid

Im not trying to get laid Richard

Clearly she has a lot of pentup sexual energy likely from working in this worm farm so thats the angle Im taking since Im not allowed to have a seizure

Besides shes going to bat for us

You should be thanking me

The CTO is on the way in

Yes because of the technology and because of our business proposal

Look can you just please for once keep your dick out of the equation

I really wish I could but my dick is the abacus  upon which this equation will be  Guys

This is our CTO

Erlich Oh great

I just said my name was Dan thats how he knows

I dont need to waste any more of your time with this

Why dont II I'll take this one from here

 Okay

Very rude Daniel

Although what can we expect after TechCrunch Disrupt when you sucker punched me in the God damn face

You fucked my wife

I fucked your wives

Plural

Both of them

Richard Erlich the customer is always right so lets just leave it at wife singular and be done with it

Okay

I need you to listen to me very carefully

It took me a very long long time to get back on my feet after I got fired from Oracle and tech firms wouldnt touch me but Ive managed to find a home here a life

Okay its insurance

Its not ideal but you know it its something

And I dont care whatever it is that youre selling here

 door closes

 Erlich Oh Dan

inhales deeply

Dan Dan Dan

Dan Melcher

The guy who beat the piss out of you

The very same

I looked him dead in the eyes and I said Daniel Ive fucked every wife youve ever had

Care to go three for three Needless to say he did not

You dont come off in that story as well as you think you do

So to avoid being thrice made a cuckold he agreed to a deal

Well uh not yet

Melcher actually signed off on it but his fianc√Ée wanted to certify that what were trying to build complies with their datahandling and security protocols

Were reviewing it all tomorrow actually

Erlich Ah I cant wait

Tomorrow the real fun begins

 Uh no

No

Youre not coming

 Why not

Why not

Uh jeez

Well you fucked Dans last wife the night before he was our judge on the TechCrunch panel with absolutely no regard for what that meant to the company

What it meant to the company was that we went to the finals and we won

Because of the tech

We won because of the tech remember

Were getting this deal because of the tech

Im not letting you fuck this up okay

I know youre looking for something to do but this is not it

What do you mean Im looking for something to do

Youre lucky that youve garnished this much of my time

Oh thats exciting

Uh yeah I guess

It It wasnt really for me

Um in fact actually just as we were taking off I walked away

 Commitment issues

 Uh I dont know

Its just I I never really thought that video chat was the best use of our compression

Kind of felt like I was settling you know

 Ooh

 Settling

 Richard Yeah our company can grow in ways  Oh fuck

that we havent even thought of yet

I mean I was going to spend the rest of my life just wondering if there was something better

Thats not really a way to live

chuckles

And what Im gonna say to all my friends like Oh this is how Im spending my time you know

Every morning I I get up and its vidchat

Then I go to bed and its vidchat

Yeah its a beautiful world Erlich

And after years of busting my ass Im finally doing it

Oh

And check it out we even have swag with my name on it

Look Monica Hall  Laurie

Hello

Well good

Now that youre both here we can dispense with the mindless chitchat

Id like to be the first to offer you both the opportunity to take me off the market

I dont understand

Im saying that I very much respect what youre doing here almost revere it and I wanted to offer my services as an associate

And I will not phone it in

I'll be the first one here at 1030 a m and the last one to leave a smidge after 400

I'll of course need an office an attractive personal assistant paternity leave if that goes well and an umbrella insurance policy if that does not go well

What do you say

Id like a job dears

The singular function of this firm is to insure that our investors money is in wise hands

If you are known for anything it is quite the opposite

Therefore no

phone clicking

Im sorry Erlich

Look I I know youre looking for something to do but Who Who is pushing this false narrative that I am looking for something to do

 But what

 But Laurie is my partner and if she doesnt think you add any real value then theres no future for you here

I gave you weed a lot of it

First I need some details

 Are you in love

 What

No no I barely know her

Okay

Okay thats good

Then we just need to extricate you from this situation

 Okay

 Now its not gonna be easy because shes very probably in love with you

Jared I I dont think that thats Richard this is no time for false humility

Youre a catch

Just deal with it

Now you need to break this thing off clean and clear so you just walk into that office and and you look her in the eyes and you say  Mmhmm

 Listen baby youre getting hitched and and I was born to roam

  Born to roam

 door opens

Hey Jared did I miss any calls

Not a good time my man

Jared

Well I think I can handle that

chuckles

All right

No um something else in here please

 Monica this salient  Mmm

Erlich noisily clears throat

Ladies

What are you doing here

I believe the answer to that question is currently sitting in your unfinished waiting area

 Holy shit

Is that  Keenan Feldspar

Yes

Why

Have you heard of him

Of course

Every competent VC has

His VR headset is reputed to be the new standard

Oh it is

I tested the prototype last night at his house

We got quite drunk

What exactly is he doing in our waiting area

Well Laurie hes waiting upon my instruction

both laugh

Imagine landing the biggest whale in the Valley two weeks before you launch your firm

Or should I say before we launch your firm

All right

The new build is done

Oh I am so glad this is over

I felt like Gibraltar in World War II where it was both crucial and inert

All right

One press of the button and we are back to normal

Whats the problem

I dont know

What dont you know

Well you seem a bit eager to resolve the situation

Youre almost anxious

 Its a new color on you

 A new color on you would be Bah bah bah

Even as you try and make a boring racist comment you cant keep your eyes off my phone

See

Now I know all my embarrassing shit is on your phone and if you look at it you will mock me endlessly and without mercy

But whats also true is that you already mock me endlessly and without mercy so I have nothing to lose and potentially a huge amount to gain

Guys this is madness

I have nothing to hide

I hear you and yet Id like to look at my phone

Sure

 Suit yourself

How do you figure

Cause now I know you had some embarrassing shit to hide
