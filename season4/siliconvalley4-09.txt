Richard Just think about it

On Saturday over a quartermillion people are gonna stream through that building

A veritable whos who of nobodies

Richard weve tried marketing at trade shows

We suck at it

No Im not talking about that

Let me ask you this We need 120000 phones right

What is the first thing people do when they get in there

Log on to free WiFi

But Hooli makes you download the Hoolicon app in order to sign in

So what if we somehow hack our code onto the app

Then we will have our 120000 phones all in one day

Im sorry

Youre youre talking about sneaking our code onto peoples phones without them even knowing about it

I mean thats malware Richard

No

No no no

Think of it more as um forced adoption through aggressive guerrilla marketing

Well as a product of forced adoption I can assure you there are consequences

 I like it

 Well hold on

Even if we get our code into that app and onto all those phones people are just gonna delete the app as soon as the conference is over

People dont delete apps

Im telling you

Get your phones out right now

 phones beep

 Uh Hipstamatic

Vine may she rest in peace

 NipAlert

 McCainPalin

 phone clicks

 All right this works in theory but penetrating the Hooli servers to hack their shitty convention app

Wed need a black hat ninja for this one

I wonder where we can find someone like that

No

 Its so great to see you Mia

 chuckles

 Hows Pakistan

 Its so great

I was there for a while and as I said before I have to go back there right after this for an extended period of time

Anyway hows all this stuff going

You must be like dying of boredom

I am but the terms of my plea agreement forbid me to touch a computer or go online so

Let me run a hypothetical by you just to like exercise your brain

Like for instance if I had to hack the Hooli app servers mess with an app and push it out over a venues free WiFi how would I do it

Its a trick question right

Because you wouldnt hack the app server

Youd just launch a maninthemiddle attack with Pineapples

Google it

Speaking of if they even catch me talking about this they could send me to maximum security prison but I think I found a way to get online

 No

 Theres a computer in the library thats not supervised on Sundays

I think if I can pull library duty I'll be able to sneak on and track down whoever ratted me out

I am going to destroy that mtherfucker

Not if I destroy him first

woman speaking on P A 

Excuse me

Whats your policy on anonymous tips

fuck

WiFi Pineapples

Its so obvious

Not to me

Look we set up a bunch of these at Hoolicon

We position ourselves between everyones devices and the real WiFi

So they log onto our boxes and our boxes log onto the real WiFi

 Exactly

 So we show them a fake landing page and force everyone to download a doctored version of the Hoolicon app

And theyll never know the difference

No wonder Mias in prison

Shes brilliant

 I think this might actually work

 Erlich Wrong

Itll never work

You dont even know what weve been talking about

I dont need to Richard

The truth is weve tried and tried

Every time weve gotten a whiff of success a giant pelican by the name of Fate takes a fourandahalfpound shit right on top of us

There are people who are destined for greatness and people who are not

Richard it seems you and I are not

And so Ive had enough

Im ending it all tonight

su1c1de

I have a book for you

No Gilf

Last night when I was sitting out there by the smoldering husk of my palapa  so cruelly taken away from me  You burned it down yourself

which led me to my epiphany

This epiphany

Greetings from Tibet

If you find yourself in Qamdo prefecture do drop in

Gavin Belson

 That was addressed to me

No that was addressed to Richard Hendricks and company

 Company of which I am a part

Youre not seriously thinking of going to Tibet

Youre broke

How the fuck are you gonna pay for that

Thats where you come in my great friends

I figured we might pass the hat

Just give whatever you are comfortable with

I'll pay for it whatever it costs

Well it seems the smallest of us has the biggest heart

Thank you young Jinathon

 Business class

 Premium economy

You fly one way

Dont you need a visa to go to China

Yes

I can call my uncle in Beijing

Hes very corrupt

That sounded ominous but gents its as I was saying Where theres a will theres a way just not for you guys

No I will not help you on this mission

No

Richard we always said we didnt want to end up like Hooli

How are we like Hooli

We are trying to give free Internet to the entire world

If we have to bend a few rules here and there I mean its all for the greater good is it not

Gavin Belson started out with lofty goals too but he just kept excusing immoral behavior just like this until one day all that was left was a sad man with funny shoes disgraced friendless and engorged with the blood of a youthful charlatan

I am never going to be any of that

Richard not that long ago you agonized over using a stolen login to get into a bakeoff with Endframe a company that stole from us

But now youre what shrugging off largescale cybercrimes against innocent civilians

Its a means to an end

Its not who I am

I mean Lincoln had to suspend habeas corpus to end the war  but he restored it after

 Lincoln

Richard its not that easy

Theres always a next time and a next time and a next time

I cannot knowingly contribute to your moral decay

Well what if you didnt do it knowingly

Youre always telling me how you spent your entire childhood pretending that everything going on around you was okay

 Uncle Jerrys game

 Yeah that

Lets play Uncle Jerrys game

Do you know what youre asking

Okay guys how we looking

 One second

 Almost done

Gilfoyle All 12 Pineapples tested and packed

Richard Jared you can come in now

All right all of our swag is in the car and I look forward to a successful promotion of our legitimate spacesaving app

Yup thats what this is

Whatever

Well now gentlemen this is it

Goodbye

Obviously I dont care to make a big deal out of it so I think its sufficient just to go around and each of you say a memory or two of times where Ive profoundly impacted your life

It doesnt have to be a profound impact

Were leaving now

 What

 International flight

Four hours early

No international flights are three hours early

Its a new rule

door opens

chuckles

Gentlemen

Okay lets have some fun

laughs

Were in the middle of the road here

 So

 Yeah who gives a fuck

Well Jared does and and we do as well

Uh you know what

Why dont you go check out what the bathroom situations like

 Yes

Nothing would make me happier

 Good

You know I actually believe him

Okay

So gentlemen okay while Jareds gone lets get our bearings

quietly

All right so we are here

Now you guys deploy the Pineapples

Start with hightraffic areas so that means entrances

People are setting up equipment everywhere so it shouldnt look that unusual but be careful dont get caught  and remember why we are here

 Winnie Richard

Whoa

Winnie

Oh yes thank you

We really think our companys message is worth getting out there

Yeah us too

Us too

Um were just trying to be a bit responsible with the spending

Sure but when I sold my last company I realized I had the luxury to invest in something I believe in

 Mmm

 Helping humanity thrive

Thats why I decided to bring PeaceFare into the world

Ah good for you

Okay

It was great to meet you Richard

Yeah and you too

 Good seeing you

 Not if I see you first

Not that you asked but you handled that very poorly

You know JianYang the silence in the car gave me some time to think about the fact that our differences Jesus

Excuse me sir do you have a moment

This morning Pied Piper were a lastminute add to the vendor list so I started watching them and noticed some suspicious behavior

I sent in for our tactical response team and with your permission Id like to sweep the convention floor with Yagi antennas which are  Hoover

 Yes sir

Four days ago I spent 2 billion on a pieceofshit VR gadget thats never gonna work

I had to rebuild the entire operating system just to get a 90second demo that could play on a phone

And by the grace of God I just may have pulled it off

And now you want to talk to me about Pied fucking Piper

Sir Id like to think that if Gavin Belson were here wed make sure Gavin fucking Belson is not here cause I fired his ass

Now look you go back to your little security room you sit in the corner with a tinfoil hat on and I swear if I hear you wandered down the hallway to take a piss you are out on your ass

You got that

PeaceFare is a game

 Dinesh What

 Yeah look at his website

 Fascinating Richard

Have you heard anything about how Pied fucking Piper is doing

Yes our code is in the app the Pineapples are online and were at 3700 downloads

Last question

Do you recognize this

Its an interview I just found from CodeRag from October of this year in which you said you and Gavin Belson would quote put Jack Barker out of a job

 Did you say that Richard

Yes

Yeah

Because apparently everything I say or type gets me into trouble because Im a idiot

 paper flutters

 Hoover Well now

 Tenley

You mean the Pineapples that I hired them to bring to the conference as part of a covert penetration test of our WiFi security

 Sorry we didnt know

 Hoover You werent supposed to

Now give these gentlemen their passes and equipment back and get them back on the floor

You know you said some very nice things about Gavin Belson in that interview

You couldve very easily kicked a good man when he was down

Good luck with whatever it is youre doing

Id walk you down myself but for reasons I really cant get into Im not allowed to leave this room

Okay

There you are

You never came back to the booth

You didnt want to see how it all turned out

I wasnt really in the mood

Are you playing PeaceFare
