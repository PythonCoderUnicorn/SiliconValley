Hello For Jim

RICHARD Yep

Oh would you would you care for a water

Why are your fingers orange

Ive been biting my nails so I put this on there to stop me from doing it

Looks like Cheetos tastes like asshole

So what do you do

Venture capital over at Wood Opal

Wow

Wow Good

 Mmhmm
 RINGING

Uh can I take this

 Sure
 All right

Hello hi

My goodness this video chat app

is lightyears ahead of anything else out there on the market

I agree

Yes and you can add multiple concurrent users with no loss in picture quality even on conventional G

Lets see what happens when we add more friends

Hi friend Whats up

Hello friend

JARED Hey should we add another friend

Yeah we should

How many friends can we conference at the same time

Well thanks to the amazing new TURN server as many as you like

What if someone is in an area with poor cellular reception

I doubt it would even work

 And if it did the lag the video quality
 SIGHS

that would be horrible

Well lets find out

Could you keep your eyes on the road please

Yeah got it Im on it

Hey friends

Wow Look at that The image is so clear

We all look amazing dont we

 Yeah we really do  Yes

Is that really just on a cell signal

Uh yes

This is the amazing new company PiperChat

Wait a minute

I saw you at TechCrunch
Youre Richard Hendricks

 The very same Yeah
 Youre the fucking guy that tried to walk into Coleman Blair with fraudulent numbers

 No
 GILFOYLE Uhoh

 JARED That was my fault
 Yes but no

I mean that thats the old thing
This is the new thing and I can assure you its very very real

Youre not even my driver This says Sandeep in an Escalade

 GILFOYLE Ah shit
 Look look

No one will even talk to us which is crazy

We just surpassed  daily active users and were growing at a rate of percent organically week over week

Richard thats Facebooklevel growth

 Pull over now
 DINESH That is great

ERLICH Richard Richard do not pull over

You will never see him again if he gets out

I am not involved

ERLICH Richard can you hear me

Okay for real Richard You have to pull over

 Richard do not do not pull over  Youll never see him again

 Hey are you on the shitter
 Pull the fuck over

 ERLICH Richard
 Okay

What the fuck Are you seriously trying to kidnap me right now

No Its the locks I I dont know
Its not my car

Child locks are on

I was babysitting my friend Glorias greatgranddaughter

 Its on the left
 BEEPS

 Got it Look look look
 God damn it

Come on Listen to me

We are desperate We need funding

 You need funding
 Yes

Hit a million daily active users while sustaining the same kind of growth then everybody in town will be trying to kidnap you

Problem solved

ERLICH Yeah easy for you to say

Can you imagine how much these servers are costing me

just to keep this ship afloat

Right and every new user increases our server cost

Really Im sorry

Is it hard to become a billionaire

Welcome to the Valley assholes

 SIGHS fuck
 DOOR CLOSES

 GILFOYLE What a dick
 Well assuming we dont get arrested looks like we have to work our asses off

 to reduce our hosting bill
 DOOR OPENS

STAMMERS

 Hi
 Hi

If you actually get to a million users call me My cells on the back

Oh okay

THEME MUSIC PLAYING

GILFOYLE Did you finish

DINESH Yeah I just pushed my code

Took me two fucking days but I broke up our entire code base into parallel services

You know this whole job wouldve been a lot easier if you hadnt designed sloppy services in the first place

Oh silly me

I guess when I hacked together the video chat as an inhouse tool

I didnt foresee that hundreds of thousands of people would shit themselves over how fucking awesome it was

I'll never underestimate my talents again

Dont worry I'll continue to do it for you

Less talk more work boys

Im not paying you to coffee klatsch like a bunch of fucking yentas

Youre not paying us at all

Im not paying you because youre not the one getting fucked facefirst by your credit card company because of massive AWS hosting fees

Well you should bear percent of the companys cost seeing as you do own percent of the company

Whats taking you so long to give us our fucking shares

Recapping a company is complex

But I assure you Big Head and I are on the case

DINESH You better be Were not gonna work for free forever

Hey the Karachi Kid and I finished

Did you push your code

Uh actually no

Well Your Highness could you please push your code

Well I couldnt push that code because I didnt write that code

What We stayed up for two fucking days

Why didnt you write your code

Well because I was working on something much better

LAUGHS

So I started to optimize our code to handle higher tr

Youre supposed to follow me

Oh

I uh I started to optimize our code to handle higher traffic

Then it occurred to me why rewrite our old code when I can build a new encoder that doesnt strip away a ton of channels and metadata

So I extended my compression algorithm to support get this bit color

LAUGHS

Okay so our users will be able to experience a percent increase in image quality with absolutely no increase in server load whatsoever

JustJustJust Just watch this

Before

After

Before

After

Richard Im trying very hard not to completely lose my shit right now

I get it I get it

After every VC in town turned us down we decided that the best way to stay alive until we got to a million users was to cut server usage

Remember that

The whole reason that Gilfoyle and I stayed up for fucking straight hours was to decrease server load not keep it the same

Technically the reason why we stayed up for two days was to maximize our ability to get a million users and I just did that

Because who doesnt want percent better image quality

Who doesnt want it Everyone

Everyone doesnt want it

GILFOYLE We already have the best video chat

People are using this on their cellphones

Theyre not gonna be able to tell the fucking difference

Guys this is a better product and Im the CEO and Im gonna say this is where we go

 You fucking prick
 Whoa

Guys please be civil

 You hate the video chat
 I dont hate the video chat Dinesh

Youve always hated the video chat because its my thing and you wanna rewrite it to make it all about you

Youre fucking jealous

Jealous Jealous SCOFFS

You built the video chat I'll give you that Okay

You did but you did it using my algorithm

Right like when Picasso painted a masterpiece the guy who made the brushes and the paint deserved all the credit right

So youre Picasso now

I think I need to leave but I love you guys

Dinesh Im sorry but I think we should be doing a little bit more with this revolutionary compression algorithm than passable video chat

But we already did more Richard

It was called the platform

And it was exactly what you wanted to make and it fucking failed okay

Im sorry but its bad enough that we cant get any funding because of you

Youre killing us out there

Dont also sabotage us in here too

Pied Piper is a video chat company

Get your head around that

Im quite certain Ive never said this before

I agree with Dinesh

Well

Oh Well that was just a whole heap of fun

Ordinarily I loathe coming to China but when you close a deal like that it makes the whole trip a delight

Champagne gentlemen

I think thats very much in order

I know you dont toot your own horn so I'll do it for you

Here to you Jack and to your HooliEndframe box becoming the most successful American data storage appliance to ever be manufactured in China

Toot toot

Watch your back Jeff Bezos here comes Hooli

All right gentlemen our flight today from Shanghai to Moffett Field in Mountain View will be just over hours so if youll just

Oh actually I was headed up to Jackson Hole see the wife and kids

I I was gonna charter up tomorrow but maybe you could ask the boys

just to drop me off on the way

Save me the trouble

Of course

Well and I mean its really not a big deal

but since we are headed east I think Jackson is further

Maybe well head to Moffett first then have the guys hop you onto Jackson okay

Well Well actually on flights like this the boys like to go over the Pole so that technically is a little more north to south and Jackson is quite a bit further north

So I think maybe just go to Jackson first then head on off to Moffett That sound good

 Of course
 Great

Im gonna get a pillow

 

You know what we desperately need is a palapa

A ploppa

A palapa

Its a Mexican structure with palm fronds

Its essentially a gazebo but spicier and with a south oftheborder kind of vibe

I think it would make us feel less exposed

And generally I think it would be good for morale

Speaking of which morale has not exactly been skyrocketing

So we need to get this cap table done tout de suite

Richard and the fellows are entitled to percent of the company

Now if we each give percent we would still own percent each

That seems fair

Seems totally fair to me

Dad

Nope Not gonna happen

Mr Bighetti with all due respect I

If you had any respect

you wouldnt have talked my son into wasting his money

again

My sons not giving up one share

Not now not ever

Mr Bighetti if youre going to control your sons board seat these decisions have to be unanimous

Youre going to kll this comp

I dont care

In my eyes the company is already dead

klled by you

Thats my edge

If all I accomplish by doing this

is making you as miserable as youve made me

watching you fleece my son

then Im okay with that

He seems okay with that

So you expect me to give the percent to the gents from my percent effectively leaving me with percent

Yes

No No no no

Then I wouldve invested thou a half of a million dollars just to end up where I started

Unacceptable

I can accept that

Im going to bed

 SIGHS
 Good night Brown Bear

Love you Papa Bear

 

LAUGHING

LAUGHING

MUTTERS gddmn mtherfucker

RICHARD I mean the guys are right
Im fucking up the company

Im not helping in any way

Youre certainly not helping your cuticles by biting on them

Your nail beds are gonna get infected

Whered you learn how to do this anyway

When I was on the street it was a means of survival

 CLEARS THROAT
 I dont know its just that

I mean I almost klled us the company and that is so selfish

I mean if we have to get a million users I need to get us funding right now

How Weve already been turned down by every respectable VC in town

 

Who said anything about respectable

Oh Richard no

fuck yes I want to talk business
Whats the play

Lets fuck this thing right in the pssy

 SCHOOL BELL RINGS
 Thanks for meeting me here

My fucking nanny got another DUI and lost her license and Im stuck picking up

my own kid like an asshole
So whats up

 PEOPLE CHATTERING
 Uhh

Well I know you wanted to buy Erlichs Pied Piper shares back in the previous iteration the platform

Well I was hoping you would want to come on as a followon investor

 for the current platform
 The video chat

Yeah Its got a great tech
Were growing like crazy

In fact thats why we need funding to keep up with the users and I think it could be really good if we could just keep it going

No you dont

What

You dont like it

You dont believe in this product youre selling

STAMMERS Russ no thats
Its a good sound business

As I said the tech is great and all the guys are really behind it

But youre not behind it Richard

I can tell and as much as you want to be youre not

Its like this

Youre trying to date a woman

 but deep down in your heart you know youre gay
 Uhh

Deep in your soul you know you would rather be plowing a dude

I dont I do Okay what dude

It could be any dude as long as you really want to fuck him

It could be a a twink a bear an otter a circuit queen a chub a pup a gipster a daddy chaser a leather man a ladyboy a Donald Duck

 STAMMERS
 Donald Ducks a gay guy whos been kicked out of the Navy

HHow do you know so many gay things

My grandfather just came out of the closet Beautiful Very inspiring

But the point is if youre gonna spend all day fucking shouldnt Pied Piper be a dude you wanna fuck

All right Lets do an exercise

Youve got unlimited time and resources you can build anything in the world you want with your compression anything at all whats it gonna be

 Three two one go Go go go
 STAMMERS

 You said I have unlimited time
 Now Now now

A new Internet

What Why

Okay Well I havent really thought this through so

Okay

 I own a telescope
 Of course you do and I brought it out one night to look at the full moon

 Of course you did
 And I got to thinking

Wow we put a man on the moon using the computing power of a handheld calculator

And then I thought Okay

theres literally millions of times

more computing power in my phone and thats just sitting in my pocket doing nothing Right

So then I thought theres what billions of phones all around the world with the same computing power just sitting in peoples pockets

So then I thought What if we use all those phones to build a massive network

And heres the kicker We use my compression algorithm to make everything small and efficient to move things around and if we could do it

we could build a completely decentralized version of our current Internet with no firewalls no tolls no government regulation no spying Information

would be totally free in every sense of the word

You wanna build a new Internet

 Yeah its
 Richard I like it

That I would fund

Well II I dont know if its possible and

Look if this new Internet is the man of your dreams and this is the man that you wanna fuck then you need to fuck him

That man I will pay you to fuck

Where the fuck is that kid

Wait a minute

Aw shit

They kicked us out of this place

Im at the wrong fucking school

Richard you find that man fuck him good

 ENGINE REVVING
 Careful please Hes gonna peel out

 Cut my life into pieces this is my last resort 

TIRES SCREECH

Monica I need to

Oh Youre not

Monica No Thank God Im Ed Chen

Laurie put me in the good office and moved Monica down the hall

Way down the hall

Okay Sorry

Youre gonna listen to Russ Hanneman

Richard you sound like a crazy person

I know but but Russ is right

TOILET FLUSHES

I mean I hate the video chat
I really do

 Oh
 What

Oh wow you can see right into the

Yeah Im very aware

Laurie is punishing me for taking your side and going against her so she moved me down here and gave my office to that little brownnosing shit Ed Chen

Anyway Richard youre not gonna seriously go home and tell the guys in your company that even though your user rates are skyrocketing that you wanna pivot

For the past hours

Ive been trying to rewrite the core video chat code and I literally cant

Instead of typing I just bite my fingernails

I think subconsciously I would rather bite my own fingers off than work on this platform

Richard I know people who have spent their entire careers chasing after an app with this kind of growth rate and never hit it

Its a really good product

That may be but its not for me

And look I know these guys are my friends but theyre also my employees and its my company

So if I say we have to pivot we pivot

Okay II I have to go

All right Well if youre sure then tell them and then call me and tell

What No I I have to go

Theres another mens room on the fourth floor

Right Cause then you wouldve seen mine twice CHUCKLES

 

I mean were all thinking it right

Richard is fucking with a product that is working

He should not be the CEO of this company




    push

 SIGHS
 I understand your concerns but is this the time that we fire Richard

Is this the moment that I become the CEO

You Why you

Its a simple process of elimination

Gilfoyle as an anarchist would never accept a position of authority

 in any official organization
 None

And you of course are out of the picture because Gilfoyle would never allow it

Yeah thats true

And Jared hed sooner commit harakiri than replace little baby Richard

So that leaves me

And honestly gents who would you rather have defending your four percent stake in the company

 Five
 What

 Five percent
 You said four Was it

You said three and then you had

 No its five
 GILFOYLE Five

You know what Im gonna back channel look at some notes and well get to it

In the meantime if and when we are to depose Richard I am his obvious heir

Erlich no offense but the board is you Richard and my dad right

So I think that means you and my dad would have to agree on who replaces Richard and pretty sure my dad would like never approve you

 Its just not gonna happen
 Thank you

 Yeah
 There is someone else

Someone who has zero strikes against him

Someone who has held highlevel positions at one of the biggest tech companies in the Valley

Someone whos been on the cover of one of the most prestigious tech publications in the world

He sounds awesome

Could we get him

 

And as of now weve got the votes of enough key Malaysian ministers to proceed with construction but that support is timecritical

Carols right Wed have to break ground before monsoon season or else the entire project could collapse

So what do you think

Sorry About what

About the factory

Ah The factory

The factory

DOOR OPENS

Excuse me for a moment

CLEARS THROAT

 So what have you got
 Well sir I did as you asked

I flew the company plane to Shanghai then Moffett then Jackson Hole

Then I flew back to Shanghai then to Jackson Hole then to Moffett which is where I just landed

 And
 Moffett is  minutes closer

I fucking knew it

Barker shouldve dropped you off first sir

Wait What about headwinds or storm activity

I dont want to give him any room to wriggle out of this

Heres what Im gonna need you to do

Fly each leg five more times and average them

Its the only way to be sure

And were not concerned with the expense of more private transcontinental flights

Of course we are

Jack Barker is costing the shareholders of this company a fortune and he must be stopped

I'll go back to Moffett right now

Good Call me each time youre in Shanghai

 I'll see you in a week
 Yes sir

 

Guys

Shit he came in the back

Richard we need to talk

Well actually let me just say something first here

I dont think Pied Piper should be a video chat company

The balls on you

Richard weve all decided you are out Big Head is in

Not my call

Richard we just cant keep fucking pivoting

 We wont do it again
 Just wait for a second okay

Just Youre not getting it Please

Uh Im quitting

Wait What

Richard I was waiting out front

They want to ambush you and replace you with Big Head but I had nothing to do with it

Again not my call

I was ready to fight you guys but then on the way home it occurred to me there might be a better way

Im going to start my own company

I will give up all of my equity in the video chat if I get to completely own my algorithm

I will grant you guys a perpetual license to use the algorithm in your video chat but I need the algorithm to build something else

And look forget a million users with me out of the company you guys would be able to raise money no problem

And that way everybody wins

So we can use the algorithm free and clear for video chat

Yes

I mean we we shouldnt even be talking about this

And you would leave behind your percent thus giving me enough equity to compensate the boys fairly and Big Heads father would retain his percent

I think thats right Yes

And I would own percent of your new company

Wait What Why

The algorithm was developed here in the Incubator

Richard shame on you

Well dealbreaker Lets Should we get some food

No no Thats okay Its fine

And Im here for advice or advice for the new CEO whoever that may be

To wit uh

I know its probably not my place to give this suggestion but I think it should be Dinesh

 What
 What

 What
 What

 Yeah Sorry Big Head
 What

Yeah Dinesh you were the one that hacked together the video chat in the first place

You know the product inside and out

You are the horse that I would bet on

You really think so

I do

Im down Gilfoyle

Gilfoyle can I please be CEO of Pied Piper

Spoken like a true leader

But since your failure as a leader is a virtual certainty tolerating your short reign as CEO in exchange for a frontrow seat to the disaster seems fair

Plus if Im wrong which Im not

I get rich So Im down with it Dinesh

Jared what do you think about this

I think this is crazy

I left my job at Hooli to to come work with you Richard

And and now youre leaving

Look these guys theyre gonna need you so if you want to support me you support them

Think you can do that

JARED Ive always been very adept at taking the shape of whatever shoe was pressed down upon me so I can try to make it work

ERLICH Then its settled

Dinesh is the new CEO of Pied Piper

Oh Actually just one last thing

I think you guys should call yourselves PiperChat

Im gonna have to insist that I keep the name Pied Piper and I wont budge on that

 Yeah its totally fine
 Okay yeah Who gives a shit

 Thats fine
 Terrible fucking name

Lets get to work

Congratulations

So wait I dont have to be CEO right

Dinesh is going to do that

ERLICH All right Lets figure out how this gets split up

GUYS CHATTERING

DINESH Lets see

And um yeah

 RICHARD Jared
 DINESH SPEAKS INDISCERNIBLY

go

Go on man

Get out of here

ERLICH Dinesh youll get five percent

Gilfoyle five percent

 Jared five percent
 DINESH Yeah Okay so we all get five not four

ERLICH Now you said you said four

DINESH No five I said five

Jared can we get five more engineers

ERLICH Thats That would come out of Jareds percentage

 DINESH No
 GUYS CHATTERING

 

SIGHS

You wanted to see me Skipper

I did indeed

Jack I appreciate everything youve done in your position as head of the HooliEndframe box but I think the companys needs are better suited if I move you elsewhere

Really

Well I appreciate the vote of confidence GB

STAMMERS Im flattered

Frankly little bit surprised

Why would you be surprised
Can you think of any reason

why you dont deserve a promotion

I mean anything at all Well

I dont want to hurt my arm patting myself on the back but right off the top of my head

No I guess not

I mean youve always been straight with me right

Straight to the point

I sure have

And youve always gone out of your way for me yes

Always put me first
Gone the extra mile

Gosh I sure tried

Did you

LAUGHS All right Jack

Professor Gary in HR will set you up

Enjoy your new offices

Thank you sir

 

Oh hey Would you like to see your desk

Okay

Here it is

This is your desk

TOILET FLUSHES

 Thethethe system will defeat itself 

 Nothin stays in a steady state 

 It overheats and melts 

 It only feeds itself 

 The system yo I think it exists 

 Just because like a pit eats its pups 

 Eats its own litter up the systems fucked its corrupt 

 Its for its own survival its genocidal 

 No place of origin no beginning cycle 

 Lets occupy all streets 

 Its crazy to think in the  s I wanted minks 

 And a Benz to listen to Michael 

 And Grand Poobah Maxwell 

 To get cash while Im sipping on drinks 

 In Nike sweatsuits and Gucci links 

 Im like a Russian mob figure Im mad low 

 In the shadows big up to Shadow 

 DDDJ Shadow we rose to throw blows 

 Cant see me but Nas moving the fastest 

 Im a D movie no needed glasses 

 Im a D movie no needed glasses 

 Hold your breath for seconds 

 Close your eyes cover your ears do not listen 

 Try to feel what Im sayin 

 To make you feel is 

 My new expression new expression
