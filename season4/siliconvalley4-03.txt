Are these my favorite nail beds Ive ever seen

No but theyre fine

Okay

You know I I wasnt actually gonna come here

But then I thought You know what

I could I could use a walk

 And um well Ive just been working on this peertopeer Internet thing and well I I think better when I walk

Mmhmm

If Im gonna be thinking and walking I might as well walk somewhere specific

Hey when was the last time you slept

Um I dont know

Well I know I I was gonna sleep last night but uh I thought I had this solve for this computational trust issue Ive been working on but it turns out I didnt have a solve

But it was too late

I had already drank the whole pot of coffee

Okay

Well Im busy

Ive got to see patients all the time

 Sorry

I dont want to interrupt you

 What are you doing

Sorry just just one second

I just had a quick thought

Why are you writing it on there

Well I mean you change these between every patient right

I guess Im going to have to now

You know all the guys at the house they think Im nuts but Im not nuts

Hey you know they say that after Alan Turing was chemically castrated he got a lot less annoying

 What was that

 Hmm

Nothing

Just thats just something to think about

Okay

Sure yeah

Pen please

Right yeah

Go ahead and pay the lady out front

Cash is always appreciated

Hmm

How the hell does this thing work

Question for you

Whats better than octopus recipe

Answer for you

Eight recipes for octopus

My grandmother gave me a family recipe before she died in a horrible way

Wait

What

Sorry

We knew JianYangs app was in the food space but we assumed that it was camerabased

Like you take a photo of food the app returns nutritional information or recipes or how it was sourced

Yeah like Shazam for food

Exactly

But this I mean this is Shazam for food

No Shazams not my vision

Of course they know that youre not pitching Shazam

That already exists

This would be a Shazam for food

 No

 Sorry

Language barrier

Do you speak Mandarin

Anybody

No

speaking mockMandarin

 Thats not Mandarin

 Hes a stickler for the accent

No my app is seafood like food  in the sea

 That you can see

Oh see food 

 SEE food

 Oh

 SeeFood

 Now that we like

 Seafood

Its like food in the sea

 speaks mockMandarin loudly

chattering

Gavin mutters

fuck

chattering

Oh Gavin

Gavin

I heard about your PiperChat issue

Those COPPA fines are no joke could be billions

Im acutely aware Jack

Listen after all youve done for me bringing me into the Hooli sandbox letting me play here what if hypothetically I had a way to delete the underage accounts and the chat data in question

Hypothetically I could blame it on a malfunction of my EndframeBox servers

The board would have nothing to blame you for

Jack Im speechless

Im embarrassed to say it but I was beginning to question your loyalty

mutters

Yeah

buzzing

Well you shouldve

I said it was hypothetical

Didnt say Id do it

 beeps

 lock clicks

Why dont you go ahead and take a seat Gavin

Uh you guys

Gavin Belson just got fired

 Jared Richard

 Big Head Wait

What

Gilfoyle Shit thats huge

There are unconfirmed reports that Belson violated Hooli protocol in the acquisition of a company that contained toxic assets

  Oh thats us

 Oh my God

Gavins been fired

Did you fall in the pool

Oh no

No I didnt

I was um I was dangling my feet in cause it was cool and refreshing and just helping me think and then since I was wet anyway I purposefully started to wade around in the pool

Uh But dont worry

No I didnt fall in

I uh chuckles

I am not a spaz

Belson will be succeeded by Action Jack Barker

A veteran tech CEO Barker commented We at Hooli pledge to work with the Federal Trade Commission to resolve this matter and commit ourselves to earning back the public trust

 Richard Wow Dinesh you really stuck it to him

Now theyre pinning it all on Gavin

 Holy shit

 Dude youre moist

Oh Im sorry

Yeah I'll go and get a towel

I mean Dinesh youre a a giant slayer

As long as hes the one taking the fall for these underage users

I thought Id have to like answer to Congress or something

Yeah that makes sense

You were worried sick about the wrath of a bloated and inept bureaucracy but feel totally comfortable having crossed a spiteful and vindictive megalomaniac with unlimited funds

Shut up

Gavin wouldnt come after me personally

I think you might be the first Pakistani man to be klled by a drone inside the United States

People dont have people klled in the Valley

Not even Gavin Belson

Okay

scoffs

Right Jared

I I once saw him throw a sloth down a flight of stairs after a presentation and he said it was an accident but he had this look in his eyes

 I I cant rule it out

 door opens

A legacy lost

CEO and chief innovator Gavin Belson exits Hooli

 The end of the Gavin Belson era

And if all goes well it is the beginning of the era of Erlich Bachman and his funky Asian dude friend Jian Jian

JianYang

Coleman Blair and Associates just offered us a seed investment of 200000 for the Shazam of food

All we have to do is dazzle them with a demo on Monday and uh the check will  What the fuck

 Huh

Is that my vintage Corona Club beach towel

Yes

I was in the pool but I got out

Erlich Thats a beach towel not a pool and it Where were you

I was referring to you as my funky Asian friend

The passenger doors all fucked up

I told you theres no demo

Im making my recipe app

Youre gonna walk away from 200000

You know who walks away from that kind of money JianYang

Richard a crazy person

Crazy

No

Opposite

He walked away from 10 million

Now look at him wet pants stealing towels babbling about technical issues that he cant solve

I am one computational trust issue away from solving this thing

Is this how you wanna end up

sighs deeply

No

Hes a cautionary tale

Richard Nope not true

Not a cautionary tale

Got a lot of work to do

I'll be in the pool

Not crazy

 I mean its like wow

laughs

 Jared Richard  Hey Erlich

 door opens closes

Just FYI

I actually did some image recognition stuff on Nip Alert so maybe you could hire me to help on the demo cause my dads been like kinda on me lately to like get a job or go to school cause cause hes upset that I lost all that money on on PiperChat

And then also you helped me lose that 20 million on Bachmanity

Big Head um JianYangs culture hes whispers

Chinese normal voice

wont allow him to accept outside help

Oh right cause of Chinese

Okay well that makes sense

If either of you could aid in the construction of this image recognition software I can pay you handsomely

Huh

Five years at ASU then you dropped out

No degree

Big Head Mmhmm

Pretty solid Cs in all of your CS classes

Right

But really more incompletes than anything

Yeah a lot of those classes were at 1100 a m  so Im sorry but I I dont think youre Stanford CS material Mr Bighetti

Yeah thats totally fair

Thanks so much

Have a nice day

Oh hey did you get this at a party on Alcatraz

 Yes

 Oh cool

I got one there too

Or I mean I guess technically I bought one there

laughs

I bought everything there

Excuse me

Oh Bachmanity was my VC fund

gasps

What

 It stands for Venture Capital

 I know

Umm Wh gasps

Wait

Nelson Bighetti

Were you on the cover of WIRED magazine

Yeah and actually inside too

chuckles

Can I get you some coffee

Gavin The last 24 hours have been very painful

But in the days to come what I will be thinking of most is all of you the good people of Hooli and what weve built together

And yes we built great products here

Great products

But I like to think we built an even greater connection

So in the spirit of that connection if any of you would like to say something to me positive or negative this is the time

I encourage you to be completely honest

man coughs

sighs

Dont be shy

This is most likely the last chance we have to talk

Anything at all

scattered coughing

Ah

Here we go

Todd our senior systems engineer

footsteps echoing

Im sorry but its my official duty to escort you off the property I understand

 Thank you for your dedication  and relieve you of your badge

Yes

I guess this is it then

Goodbye Hoover

Your parking hang tag

Richard I mean do you think Im crazy for chasing this thing

Dont ask me

Im hardly in a position to judge

I mean you do realize Im literally the only person in this entire grocery store whos actually buying stuff for myself

I dont know

Maybe these people are right

Maybe I just drop this one move on and become some pathetic fucking TaskRabbit you know

Hey I have a family asshole

Oh

Sorry

Not you the other ones

Look if you cant crack this idea theres no shame

I mean a lot of really smart people have gotten stuck on it

Please

Like who

Peter Gregory for one

Peter was thinking about a fully decentralized Internet

Why wouldnt you mention this to me

Well because he walked away from it and you seemed so excited about it I thought you had a new angle

I didnt want to discourage you

Oh what cause Im some delicate little flower

I couldnt handle it

The thing is Peter tended to cling to things and he gave up on this

I mean he mustve had a reason

Wait

Peter was a compulsive notetaker

Right

What about his journals

I mean do you guys still have them

Richard I am on thin ice as it is at Raviga

No

Monica listen to me okay

I havent slept in days

Im walking into pools fully clothed

This is all I think about

Please

Fine but just this once

 Yes

Thank you

 cell phone buzzes

 fuck

Its Erlich

He  What

He wants me to help spin up this demo for JianYangs bullshit Shazamforfood app

Wait the thing that Coleman Blair just bought

That was them

Yeah but they havent bought it yet

I mean they sign the deal on Monday but its all contingent on a working demo which they do not and will not have

Interesting

Youre doing great work by the way

 fuck you

 Definitely

Thank you

I'll have those forms to you by 11

Yeah so its called SeeFood but its SEE Food get it

Yes Erlich Bachman showed me a demo and this thing is incredible

Yeah and Coleman Blair is gonna get the whole deal for only 200K

But heres the thing they dont close until Monday

I mean if I had Lauries ear I would tell her that we should pay them today and close the deal and Bachman would jump on it in a second

scoffs mutters

Go choke on that broham

Dinesh Very funny

 Whats funny

 This message

Hey Im a big fan of what you did to Gavin Belson

Ive seen your photo and think youre cute

Would love to meet up Mia 

 fuck you

 I didnt send that

 Oh you didnt

 My hand to Satan

But before you go ahead and get a little brown boner in your pants you might wanna consider that its not a woman

I bet youre being catfished by Gavin himself

Oh fuck

 But  But what

On the off chance that this is an actual real woman getting mrderd seems like an acceptable risk

door opens and shuts

 Oh hey

 Hey

Let me ask you something

Do you think wearing the name of the college youre going to to class is like the same thing as wearing the name of the band youre going to to a concert

 What

 Did you get into Stanford

Yeah and this is totally going to get my dad off my back and they said they liked my story so Im gonna take a CS class there

And theyre so nice

I was asking if it was gonna be passfail and they were like Its up to you

 And then I said Is there gonna be homework And they were like Only if you want it

 And so then I guess I have to decide if I want it which kinda already feels like homework but do you think I Richard Holy shit

Its like we just walked right into Peter Gregorys brain

Actually I think Peters brain is in a cryolocker in Menlo Park

Oh hey I uh I remember this photo from Peters office

Its still so weird to me that he and Gavin Belson were ever friends

whirs

Select destination

 No

No no

No thank you

 Optimizing route to Arallon

Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

Hold on

Wait

Are all these Peter Gregorys notebooks

Monica Um  Are they

Are they in this box

 Richard

Remember you promised you were gonna get some sleep tonight

Yeah I will

All right Im uh Im gonna leave you guys to it

Oh Erlich didnt get a call from Ed Chen today did he

Yeah

I heard them on speakerphone cause Erlich was netipotting

I think uh I think theyre meeting tonight

Good to know

 What

 Sesame seeds

 To SeeFood

 To SeeFood and to a fullexpensed meal on Ravigas tab and to you Ed Chen who pulled the wool over Laurie Breams eyes and got us twohundothou sight unseen

Well she had some concerns about getting into business with you again but I can pretty much talk that broad into anything

 Ha

Cheers to that

 laughs

JianYing laughs

Youre a con man like Erlich

chuckles

What does that mean

It its a little term of endearment we have around the house

Uh a confident man

He sees me as a confident man and he looks up to me

You know you have to be patient with him  cause hes a bit of a moron

 Moron

No no no

I mean hes Not in tech

And how about this palapa

Are we in the islands or what

Sorry

I This app isnt gonna suck right

If it sucks its my ass

You guys have a working demo right

laughing

Uh were gonna slow down on the uh thethe the servings for the little one

So hes from China a small town not used to our big city liquor and No no no no no

JianYang

Boys boys

Im a big fat fucking asshole

 Okay now

Thats thats me

Why would I call myself a big fat asshole

The liquors gotten to the little fellow and I wouldnt listen to a word he has to say

  gn firing on video game

Oh hey Gilfoyle

This is Mia

Are you gonna mrder Dinesh

 No

 Bummer

Wait

Gilfoyle

 Are you the Gilfoyle from Bovine Dawn

 controller beeps

Maybe

Im MI4

Gilfoyle No shit

I always thought you were a fat bald weirdo

Well shes not

Shes a thin hairy regular

You know you were totally wrong about the dump of all the hacking teams best exploits

No if you look at what happened with the Equation Group it was basically the same thing

Shes right youre wrong

Um shall we head out

Dont wait up

Oh my God

 Oh my fucking God

 Richard what is it

Jared look

Its all here

Peter Gregory knew the value of a completely decentralized Internet

I mean Look look

The Internet we deserve

 chuckles

I mean look even back then Peter was worried that the Internet would become this shitty corporatecontrolled thing that that Hooli and all these other companies manipulate today

But the idea is real

Its just that Peter didnt think it was feasible unless compression surpassed the theoretical limit of a 2

9 Weissman Score

We shattered that limit at TechCrunch Disrupt

 Yeah baby

Exactly

 Ha




    push

I mean goddammit

I always knew there was a perfect application for my algorithm

These notes all this this is going to save me months

This is it

I mean I was right all along

I was right

Can I just can I try something

Yeah

Woo

laughs

 Okay

 I dont know

 Woo

 Woo

Woo

Woo

Woo

 Sorry

 Thats okay

So do you like movies

Depends on the movie

Im the exact same way

It being a movie doesnt mean Im gonna like it

Would you care for some wine or a cocktail tonight

Uh just water please

Just water please

I love water

I do

Oceans rivers lakes

When does a pond become a lake

I wonder if its depth

Where are those waters

Felt like we ordered waters a while ago

 And What

 cell phone buzzes

mutters

fucking prick

 What

 Oh nothing

It was just a text from Gilfoyle

Gilfoyle isnt a prick

 Yeah Im sorry

 Hes a mtherfucking prick

 What

 That guy sucks

Everyone hates him on the message boards

You know putting a face to the name made so much sense

Right cause his face sucks too

 Totally

 Yeah

I have to find this one post of his

It was insane

You know he has no friends

He pretends like hes all dry and witty but hes just a monotone piece of shit

And being a Satanist just means youre ugly and youre leaning into it

laughs

 Thats right

 laughs

You know what

Can I get a glass of Malbec

Unless Do you want to get a bottle

Yeah

Lets get a bottle of Malbec

 fucking Gilfoyle

 Right

students chattering

Woman Mr

Bighetti

When youre ready

Uh ready for what

class laughs

Im like the class clown already

Why is my name on the board

 class laughs

 mutters

Oh no

Laurie you wanted to see me

Oh

Yes Monica sit

Are you pregnant

 Yes

 Congratulations

 On

 On being pregnant

Oh

Yes

Friday afternoon Ed Chen convinced me to bid against Coleman Blair on an app entitled SeeFood

Its run by Bachman and the one who smoked in the offices

Well I Ed is very persuasive

This morning he made the case that since you have a longstanding relationship with Bachman and since you are a talented VC who deserves a second chance his words you should take lead

What

Richard I mean look at this drawing

I drew the exact same thing on my doctors butt paper

I mean Peter had the exact same idea

He was just waiting for compression to catch up which it did thanks to me

laughs

Cheer up Richard

Yes but heres the best part okay

Peter never foresaw the ubiquity of Internet connected computing devices

Right

Camera refrigerators TVs baby monitors not to mention the billionsplus smartphones that are floating around the world

I mean who here has a smartphone right

You you me JianYang Dinesh Monica Richard you dont have to name everyone you know

Point is you all thought I was crazy when I walked into the swimming pool with my clothes on  but it turns out I was fucking right

 door opens closes

Okay

So not crazy

Opposite

You poor idiots

laughs

How was school Timmy

Oh not great

They made me teach

 Teach what

 Stanford

Youre a professor at Stanford now Big Head

No that would be crazy

 Im a guest lecturer

 door knob rattles

knocks on door

 pounds on door

 door opens

What are you doing

It was open and you have the keys

Huh

Strange

Did you change the locks

Cause the keys were working last night when I went for my date

Cause I havent come back to the house since my date so I did sx on her

 Good

 Cool

Yeah thats great

Nice man

Who is she

Her name is Mia and she is aMiazing

She hates Gilfoyle almost as much as I do so Huh

Jumping headlong into a sexual relationship with MI4

Ballsy

But Im sure youve thought through the consequences

Well we werent really doing a lot of thinking

You know what I mean

 Oh wow

 Mia is a legit hacker

People say that shes taken on the Chinese government and here you are after one meal in an intimate relationship

  So

So what do you think shell do if you try to break up with her

Or disagree with her

Or disappoint her in any way like by confessing that your badass takedown of Gavin Belson was a total accident

Unless youve already told her

It didnt come up

Well Im sure that when she finds out that your entire relationship is based on a lie of omission shell be very understanding

So what

We just wont breakup

Ever

 Ever

 door opens

sighs

Erlich

Do you know how badly Ed Chen just fucked me with Laurie

Let me tell you something

A threesome is always awkward especially the first one

Laurie being a little bit older Im talking about SeeFood

What do you and JianYang have

Oh

A whole lot of nothing

 sighs

 Are you No

No no no no no

SeeFood has to be great

My job depends on it

Ed Chen bailed and dumped the whole thing on me

Richard can I speak with you in the kitchen for a moment

Yup

Sure

So whats up

Well heres the thing

Remember that phone number you were curious about in here

Well its not a phone number

Its a patent number

A patent for exactly what you were planning to build

So Peter patented it

No I um  I spoke to Brian Fong

 Who

 Brian Fong

 Oh

And he told me that Peter was very excited about the idea but there was some resentment that he wasnt focused more on what the team was working on so one of them went out and got a patent on it

Why didnt this guy pursue it

Well the patent was just a roadblock to keep Peter focused on the company they were starting a company that went on to be known as Hooli

Wait wait

Wait wait wait

Sst

So youre telling me that the perfect application of my algorithm belongs to Gavin fucking Belson

Jared Im afraid so

Richard are you okay

Uh yes

Just putting something away

clattering

panting

 door closes

 Yep

Not crazy
