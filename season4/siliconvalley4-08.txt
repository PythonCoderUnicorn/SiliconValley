ERLICH A little to the right

The right more

More

More

Woof

Aces

 We did it

 Busy

Hey

Come on in

Im just putting the finishing touches on Bachmans Operational Center

Can you believe that I talked the ladies into letting me keep that little piece of genius in here

 Oh

Sweet

 Sweet indeed

Its human hair

Where have you been

Weve been trying to close your deal

Monica and Laurie are really fighting me on one final deal point and I was getting bummed so I turned my phone off went kitesurfing in Fiji

When I got back I was chill again and I got a message that they agreed

So you closed

Yep

What was that one little pesky deal point

I think youre gonna like it

SHOUTS

fuck yeah

A keyman clause

Yes and said keyman is none other than yours truly

Its the highest honor that you can bestow on a VC

Wow

So you get shares in the company

 No

 So you get a seat On the board

I do not

 A bonus

 Theres no cash involved but if Monica or Laurie tries to oust me from BreamHall Keenan Feldspar can void the deal and walk

So basically this new title just means that you for sure get to keep your shitty desk job

Congratulations but Erlich can you please turn on the heat

Its freezing in here

Tsktsk Richard

Negativity

Hey have you seen Keenans demo

Reddit is sh1tting itself over it

Of course Ive seen it

Im his keyman

He gave me one of the first opportunities to shit myself over it

 Its that good

 Guys come on

How good can it be

VR is just a fad

Oh Richard

Ive forgotten what an envious little crone you can be

Envious

Me

Of who

Keenan Feldspar

Of course

Keenan was born with a golden horseshoe up his ass while you sit here toiling away in an icebox you call your home office cursed with the Midas touch of shit

Im not cursed and the icebox youre referring to is your house okay

TAB SNAPS

What

Uh guys I just got a billing alert from Azure

Apparently all of our cold data has gone hot so weve already exceeded our monthly server budget

Monthly

Bullshit

Its been four days

What the fuck

We have to store Melchers data there until we have enough phones

We cant afford this

Im gonna call Melcher

Hey Richard

How we doing

Is there something going on with your data

Because it was basically parked until a few hours ago when it started flying on and off our network like crazy

Well arent you arent you watching the weather channel

No why

Is there a hurricane or something

 Worse

Its cold outside

 Okay

So

California looses its mind when it gets cold

ON PHONE

Citrus trees start freezing

Sometimes theres actual frost on the road you know then people start filing claims like crazy

Our whole office is going nuts right now

 CART SQUEAKING

 RICHARD Well that kind of data traffic is costing us a fortune

Thats the beauty of the deal we made Richard

You agreed to store our data for a flat rate

Everyone else in my division is getting gouged on their storage and bandwidth fees right now but thanks to you I look like a genius

 I'll tell Liz you say hi

 Oh

Oh no

No no thats okay

 What did he say

 He says hi

And that we are responsible for the overages

fuck

Maybe you are cursed

Im not

Thats ridiculous

Theres no such thing

 SNAPS FIZZLES

 fucking what

Richard a bill of this size is going to be problematic

 SIGHS

 DINESH Problematic

Catastrophic

Were not gonna be able to pay that bill  so our servers gonna get cut off  POPS SPRAYING

which means were gonna lose Melchers data which means hes gonna sue us and seize our assets and our patents and the entire future of the fucking Internet is gonna belong to a fucking insurance company

I cant take this shit anymore

Admit it

Were fucked

Okay lets just think

Lets just think

Dan Melcher runs a very conservative insurance company but even he was willing to pay us up front for data storage right

True

Although that was complicated

What

It its just a such a intheweeds deal

Point being we can find another customer and then use that upfront payment to cover Melchers fees

Thats like getting a new credit card to pay off your old credit card

Yeah and as CFO I should tell you weve already done that seven times

Look I dont have any moral issue with any of that but it was hard enough to get Melcher

How the fuck are we gonna get a second Melcher

SIGHS

 LIGHTER FLICKING

 RICHARD Its cold out here

Can almost see my breath huh

What do you want

Well uh its just that the guys are a little agitated because we seem to be having minor money troubles

I was thinking since you and BreamHall signed such a big check over to Keenan Feldspar and since you are his keyman maybe you could help set up a data storage deal like we had with Melcher

Merely tens of minutes ago you were rubbing VRs face in a pile of its own make that means shit and now VR is supposed to be your lifeboat

Just to remind you Erlich you are also an investor in Pied Piper

It would be good for everyone including you

Very well

Fill me in on the details of your little proposal

Pitch

What do you mean

You you know the details

You were there with me for every single pitch meeting

And Im sorry that I wasnt key in those meetings so I dont recall all of the little nittygritty details

LIGHTER FLICKS

Saving you 25 percent on your data storage which makes us pretty deserving of the Weissman trophy

LAUGHING

You know the Heisman trophy from athletics

Dude

This demo is insane

Gentlemen youre stepping on Richards laughs

Im sorry but I walked up a hill and on top of the hill there was a tavern

And I walked into the tavern and I could just look everywhere and there was a barmaid

Guess what

I walked right up to the barmaid and I just looked at her for a really long time

This technology could change the world

Im not one to gush but the possibilities of your consequencefree reality are darkly promising

So stoked you guys liked it

I hacked it together last summer and I just guessed right on a lot of the details

But if you think that was cool wait till you see our final hardware which is en route from China

Its gorgeous

Well enjoy it while it lasts just cause you know this can be a tough business

Is it

So Richard CLAPS HANDS

you wanna try the demo

Uh no thanks

No Im Im not a VR guy

Richard doesnt like things that are cool or fun or taste good

Plus it makes him queasy

He has a sensitive constitution

Ah come on

Youre gonna do it

Look at him

Hes gonna do it

Its gonna be awesome

Come on

Youre doing it

 Come on come on

After you

 Okay sure

I guess

Fine

RETCHES

TOILET FLUSHES

GROANS

Wow

You really vomited a lot  and like immediately

 Yeah

Yeah

 Bad luck I guess

 Yeah so CLEARS THROAT

Look anyway about that data storage deal

Oh

Yeah

If Erlich says it works thats good enough for me

Lets do it

 Really

Okay

 KEENAN Yeah

Perfect

Thats great

Um well I guess we should get back to the house  draw up some paperwork for that

 JARED Mmhmm

We should be able to pull everything together by Monday

Is it cool if we hang out just to like play around with the VR some more

Okay but Im sure Keenans busy

Nah

You guys should stay

You want a beer

I just put in a fresh keg

He put in a fresh keg

 Its so warm in here

 That would be the subfloor heating

I didnt even know I had it

It just came with the house

GILFOYLE Thats nice

What are you telling me

Box Two is delayed

We were already facing some design and production challenges but then this cold snap happened

Apparently there was frost on the loading dock at our microprocessor plant in Acton

So its cold outside

Why does everyone in this state have to be such a wimp about it

Well a semitruck slid right through the door and hit the main breaker panel and melted down the entire facility

The driver was incinerated instantly

I see

Well our thoughts and prayers obviously but well still be ready to roll out in time for Hoolicon right

Guys

Hey

Im not Gavin Belson

You can be honest with me

How many days will this set us back

Were going to miss delivery of product by two quarters

You realize Hoolicon is in one week right

I mean its my first Hoolicon as CEO of this company

I Im supposed to get up on stage in front of an audience of thousands and deliver a keynote presentation built entirely around the release of Box Two

I was going to descend onto the stage in a giant box

Boom

Jackinthebox

Then Mike Tyson and Floyd Mayweather were gonna come out and box over who was gonna get to take home the first new box

These are worldclass puns

Now I got nothing

 Hello

 FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

LAUGHS

Hey guys

I have something to show you

 Have you been here all weekend

 Is that the sushi guy

CHUCKLES

Matching pajamas

You guys look like youre in a cult

Oh Keenan gets these for free

Yeah were not gonna wear the same thing three days straight

You gotta come check this out

This way

EXHALES

Wow

I didnt feel sick at all not once

Not even going up the hill

No

No no nausea at all

Yeah I felt fine the entire time

Whatd you do

Did you reduce the latency

I didnt

You did

Dinesh and Gilfoyle helped me integrate your middleout compression algorithm into my codec

 Im sorry

What

 Its off the charts now man

We were even able to push the barmaid to the cloud

These two guys are mad geniuses

Hang on

I have something for ya

Mmhmm

What the fuck

You just gave our proprietary technology to this asshole without even running it by me first

 Are you serious

 We were just hanging out and he was like We should try it and he said we could delete it and then he started getting really excited

And then he said you know Youre doing it a bunch of times and then we did it

And then we started getting really excited  and it was so exciting

 And it worked

The VR is rad now

Gilfoyle rad

You are wearing the exact same pajamas as Dinesh and youre saying rad now

You have been sucked entirely into his little Keenan vortex

Okay

I grant you with CLEARS THROAT

the benefit of even a seconds distance this isnt a good look

I dont know

I think we look rad

Just just hear Keenan out okay

 On what

 Here you go Richard

 Whats this

 Its an offer

 I want to acquire Pied Piper

 Oh

 SCOFFS

 KEENAN LAUGHS

Bingo 2009 the HooliPad touchscreen was recalled five days before Gavin Belsons Hoolicon keynote

Now if he can pull something together that fast certainly I can

 KEYBOARD CLACKING

 Well sir I really dont see the value in you comparing yourself so closely to Gavin Belson

Meaning what exactly

Nothing

Just that hes considered the greatest showman the tech world has ever seen

KEYBOARD CLACKS

I mean just look at him

Weve blown away the FIPS 1402 standard for security and thats been certified by NISTCSE as you can see  JACK Wow

 there

 CROWD CHEERING

 Look at the confidence the poise

Look at the stage presence

is accessible here we go through the dropdown menu  there

 How could I top that

 CROWD CHEERING

 Oh I dont think anyone ever will

When he looked at you you felt like you were  the only two people in the world

 Hoover

 Yes sir

 GAVIN CONTINUES SPEAKING

Get the fuck out of my office this instant

 HOOVER Sorry sir

 GAVIN CONTINUES SPEAKING

Anyone here use our enterprise server

Weve taken secure authentication  to a whole other level

 Jack Barker youre gonna need a miracle

Anyone care to talk secure biometrics

Well considering our looming debts and the embryonic state of our network this is a very generous offer

But were not for sale guys

Richard listen its like weve been lost at sea for a long time on a tiny boat and there is no wind

And now through sheer luck weve just happen to drift right up to Hawaii

Now we can continue sailing into the unknown and probably sink or die of starvation or scurvy or we can get off in Hawaii

Lets get off in Hawaii

 Whats so good about Hawaii

 Have you never been

 No

 Its very nice

I think we should take it

Okay everything Keenan touches turns to gold and you are different than that

 DOOR OPENS CLOSES

 I want to go to Hawaii

fucking Keenan Feldspar

How dare he put me in this position

Everything just comes so easy to him

He invents one little thing and then hes gonna make a billion dollars and just Oh Keenan Feldspar gets whatever he wants and now I have to be the ogre that says no to him

Great

Richard you are my captain and Im your mate

And I will sleep in the bilge with the vermin and I will eat hardtack and I will say Thank you

 And if duty requires I will stand on deck and I will salute you as we sink beneath the waves

But as poor as our odds are Im worried that if we turn down this offer we will lose the rest of our crew and if that happens you will lose everything Richard

Your algorithm

So youre saying that if I say no to this I risk having a mutiny on my hands

Aye Captain

Thanks

PAPERS RUSTLE

SCOFFS

fuck you Keenan Feldspar

 Whoa

 Problem

Your counteroffer here is really really high

Yes but after crunching the old numbies um theres no way we could make an acquisition work for even just a penny less than that number right there you know what with the patent and the IP

And you said yourself my guys are the best

So Keenan as you know the best is expensive

This is more than I just took in funding from BreamHall and you want all cash

 I cant do that

 Really

Oh rats

Rats rats rats

SIGHS

Weird

I wanted this to happen but it didnt

That sucks

I wanted it too very badly

But um you know what they say in life You cant always get what you want

 This feeling sucks

Trust me you get used to it

GILFOYLE Wait

Keenan said no

To us

I guess you can never really know someone until you ask them to put their money where their mouth is

You know kind of a shitty thing to do

Kind of a shitty little dude

Anyway well lesson learned

Anyhoo as soon as Erlich comes in and brings us our signed data storage contract from Keenan well be all set

Well be back in business

Huh

Go team

Lets celebrate

Lets lets put on some music

We never do that

What was the number

 What number

 Your counteroffer to Keenan

What was the number you went back to him with

Well Gilfoyle to be honest these deals are pretty complicated

 Richard what was the number

 DOOR OPENS




    push

Twentyfive million fucking dollars

 DOOR CLOSES

 Wait

What

You heard the manchild right

Richie had the quail eggs to counter 25 million

Isnt that right Richard

What

Thats fucking crazy

Yeah I thought so too but you know whats even crazier than that

You guys got yourself a fucking deal

 LAUGHS

 What

Okay so this is 25 million

This is real

 As crystal

 Yeah Im Im not gonna lie when you first told me that number I had a feeling of mad

But then I had lunch and after that I was a little tired but I mostly felt pretty okay

And thats when it hit me

This is a guy who knows how valuable he is

It got me to thinking that perhaps I had undervalued my own company especially because now I have this baller algorithm thats solving all my latency issues

Well my algorithm

So I called Big Cat here and we slid that new demo over to Raviga

Ed Chen liked it so much he offered to triple the BreamHall deal

But the BreamHall deal is signed

Its done right

Was done

Enter the keyman the big cat

You see if I quit BreamHall then Keenan is free to do whatever he wants

 You quit BreamHall

 Two hours ago

Ten minutes later we were in a handshake deal at Raviga

This adorable little wombat made clear his intentions that he wants me to be the new COO of his company along with a five percent stake

And now we can all work together on this dopeass shit and make a fuckton of money while were doing it

See

It always works out

 It does

Whos drinking

 To the palapa

Yeah

Pour me one Big Cat

DINESH Jared theres no pink glasses

Richard I know you think Im a bullshit artist

Its okay

I totally am

I have this gift where I can make people do whatever I want em to do and they dont even realize theyre doing it

Right

Richard you have the greatest technology that Ive ever seen

You can change the fucking world

You just have to get people excited about it

Thats where I come in

You and me together bro

Look how strong this is

fucking forget about it

Were gonna be fucking cutting class and crushing ass

You really think that you can get people excited about Pied Piper

Richard thats what I do

You know youre doing it

Oh I can see it

CHUCKLES

He knows

The wheels are already turning

Well  Maybe

 Come on youre fucking doing it

Lets do it buddy

Lets fucking do it

Okay

Yeah

 Come on

 Well okay

Jared here we go

Oh Im just gonna wait

 Okay here you are

 Yeah

KEENAN Get out there

LAUGHS

PANTING

 Richard

 RICHARD Yeah

Are are we okay

Uh no Jared were were not okay

CRICKETS CHIRPING

Were fucking rich

CHEERING

When we come down terrorizing your town Running with my wolves and we out on the prowl If you didnt know it you knowing it now I'll always be a mothafucking problem child We the boys everybody warned you about Im a problem child I be throwing tantrums Sorry its a bit nutty around here

Yeah

CLEARS THROAT

Well I just wanna say how sorry I am that Erlich flaked on you guys

 Not your fault

 Also CLEARS THROAT

and I know this might piss you off to some degree I have decided to make a deal with Keenan Feldspar

What

Why

He made a really good offer

Lots of money and hes got my back so

Right well its not like him to talk you into a deal and then just totally fuck you over

Yeah

No

Look hes copped up to all that

I mean he was very honest about the whole Keenan vortex thing so

Well you dont think his discussing the vortex is just a way of pulling you into the vortex

No

Whwhy would he wh Son of a bitch

Yeah

Okay look Richard what Im about to tell you is a huge breach of ethics but its gonna save you from making a big mistake

Keenan and Erlichs little keyman game is the greatest thing that happened to this firm

Id like to hear why

A no more Erlich

And if that werent enough we get our 20 million back

But the biggest reason is that we realized once we took a look under the hood Keenans tech is dog shit

No

No its not dog shit

I thought so too but then I tried the demo and its pretty amazing

Theres this point in the tavern uh where you meet this barmaid and you can look wherever you want however long you want

Yeah well um look the demo is amazing when you run it on a 10000 rig

But the future of VR is mobile and theres no phone on Earth that could handle that demo let alone the fullbloated platform

Isnt that why Keenan has acquired us

I mean to help him figure that out

No he just wants you to make the demo better so he can take as much money off the table as he can

Hell walk away rich the company will crater and you will go down with it and that would be the end of Pied Piper

Richard you have to tell Keenan that youre not gonna take this deal

SIGHS

fuck

What do I do

How am I supposed to tell the guys that Im taking away their payday

You dont understand

Keenan had us pouring champagne all over each other like a bunch of fucking douchebags

I honestly dont think they even care that the tech is shit

They just want to go to Hawaii

 Hawaii

 Its a metaphor weve been using

Were pirates and our ship is sinking and Keenan is Hawaii

This is what you talk about all day

Look

CLEARS THROAT

This deal was our only hope and with all due respect you run your own firm and youre not exactly chomping at the chance to fund us are you

Because youre still theoretical

Look I'll make you a promise

If you can get all of Melchers data onto a stable network of mobile devices and prove that this works I will fund your A round

 Really

 You have my word but you have to tell Keenan no deal

Uh guys

Oh he came in the front this time

Oh

CLEARS THROAT

So we need to talk to you

You need to talk to me

You may want to have a seat

Okay

CLEARS THROAT

Is that a new sweater

Hey Richard theres some bad news

JARED Richard right before Keenan signed the Raviga deal somebody else swooped in and offered him an absurd amount of money for his company and he took it

Really

So Keenan sold his company

Deals off the table

Were not going to Hawaii

Oh no

Oh no

Listen Richard we know you fought really hard for this deal

We will never forget that

Yeah I did and I would gladly fight for it and you guys again

Gosh damn

Argh

You dont seem that mad

I am

I am Gilfoyle

Im pissed

If if you need to kick another hole in the door wed understand

Oh yeah

No I I might

I might have to

Really I just If I dont calm down I will

I will take you up on that

Who uh Who did he sell to

The only other company that could guarantee viable middleout compression

 Hooli

 GILFOYLE Yup

Hooli

He sold to Hooli

What a dick move

Yeah I mean thats not the half of it

I mean once he figured out what Erlichs five percent would be worth he left him out in the cold

Wait

He he got Erlich to quit his job and then cut him out of the deal

 GILFOYLE Mmhmm

 Jesus

We thought you were cursed but maybe it was just your proximity to Erlich

I mean that dude mustve driven a van over a bunch of gypsies in a previous life

 Where is he

 I saw him grab his lighter and his bong and head out to the palapa to sulk a few minutes ago

Isnt that his bong right there

Well shit

FIRE CRACKLING

Guys theres a fire

We need the fire guys

Someone call the fire guys

DISTANTLY

Erlich

CRACKLING

DOOR OPENS

Hey buddy

Still not talking huh

Youve been out here all night

Its freezing

You sure you dont wanna come back inside

SIGHS

Yeah it was a nice palapa

Well concretes still pretty warm from the fire

He should be okay for at least a few more hours

Well thats probably longer than well be in business

Yeah we got our first pastdue notice from Azure

They said we have five business days till they cut us off

If you guys wanna feel worse check this out

  Jack ON COMPUTER

 Come join us for an epic gathering where we come together as one people as visionaries

MAN Is this not the most exciting time to be in technology

 CROWD CHEERING

 The whole thing is just like Wow

 JACK The most transformative technology event in the world

Hoolicon

See you all at Hoolicon

I hope youre excited

I know vee are

 Yeah VR

fucking Keenan Feldspar

Jared how many people attend Hoolicon

About a quarter of a million over the whole weekend

And Gilfoyle um how many more phones do we need to get us off Azure

A hundred and twentythree thousand give or take

Dinesh how much are tickets to Hoolicon

Why would I have that information

ROCK MUSIC PLAYING

Tell me what you think are we in trouble

Feeling sorrys never really been my struggle Picking up the pieces sifting through the rubble Ringing in the new year listening to the Double Are we outside The safe spaces of love Are we in space pinned down To spinning rocks

How you Freeze me Were so cold now Are we outside in space

So cold so cold
