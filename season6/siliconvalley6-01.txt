You wish to acquire a company called Sliceline

I will be taking on a total engineering team of about 50

I just have to go back into my office

Well we thought the best way to introduce the PiperNet would be through the eight developers

I have been cooking up a killer new game

The Gates of Galloo

We put this thing on PiperNet Bam 80000 instant users

Partnering with a company of that size this early would put us months ahead

Knock em dead Richard

Whatever you are doing stop it now

Um yeah were just highfiving

Bye

You need to make a deal with my companies

Taking existing companies and just calling them new isnt sophisticated thats theft

So theyre manufacturing phones and signing them onto our network

Why would they wanna help us

Theyre not helping us theyre attacking us

 Its the 51 percent attack

 Im sorry what

A 51 percent Weve been exploring the viability of an acquisition with Amazon

You expect me to work for Jeff Bezos

No way

I happen to know that they fucked you over

How would you like to fuck them back

I need you to attack me

 A second attack

 Yes

Boom you just got 80000 new users

Colin you did it you saved us

Gilfoyle the patch

Bombs away

Oh my God

These are our new offices

Were actually right through here

What do you guys think

Do you want to see the second floor

Theres another floor

Okay

Whoa

I know its exciting right

Here we are right here to the left

I like your tie

Oh thank you

I tied it myself

Oh Okay

Well good luck

Mr

Hendricks thank you for being here

For the last three hours weve been asking some prominent members of your industry questions about the security of their users data

And while the gentlemen from Facebook Google and Amazon have acknowledged some egregious lapses in the past And Hooli sir

Hooli also acknowledged some spectacular lapses

Yes

As I was saying these fine folks have been assuring us all that their oversights are behind them and that they are the best people to protect their users privacy

But my colleague Senator Shizaki of the great state of Hawaii suggested that you might have a different view

Senator

Thank you Chairman Hubbard

Mr Hendricks and his company Pied Piper are developing a pilot program to deliver wireless Internet to my constituents on the island of Maui

I have asked him to deliver a statement here today

Mr Hendricks

Yes

Mr Hendricks now would be the time for that statement

Okay

I probably shouldve gotten these out before

He looks like a child in a custody hearing

But like you dont feel sorry for him

You just want him to go away and not have any parents at all

Hello I am Richard Hendricks CEO of Pied Piper

There you go

 Eye contact

 Im proud to tell you that we are working with Senator Shizaki  Good

 on developing the first step in providing a new type of Internet to the world

Oh Hold on

Uh basically itit is a program that iiits kinda Actually can I pace

II just think better on my feet

So a lot of people Mr

Hendricks

Speak into the machine

Oh

Okay

Im sorry

Does this come out

Perfect

 fuck

 Okay so these people up here right

You want to rein them in but you cant

Uh Facebook owns 80 of mobile social traffic

Google owns 92 of search and Amazon Web Services is bigger than their next four competitors combined

And they will be even more robust once the Hooli merger is complete

Ah see

Look there

Even Hooli cant survive these monopolies

No one can

They track our every move they monitor every moment in our lives andand they exploit our data for profit

And you can ask them all the questions you want but theyre not gonna change they dont have to

These companies are kings and they rule over kingdoms far larger than any nation in human history

They won we lost

So why are you here

Because look at where we are

Yeah

 We are in the seat of the US government  Mr Hendricks

Im okay

Ive got it now

We are in the seat of the US government a government that was founded by people who were at one point ruled by kings they couldnt overthrow

So what did they do right

They started over

They came here to the New World

World 2

0 version 1776

And the way we win is by creating a new democratic decentralized Internet one where the behavior of companies like this will be impossible forever

One where it is the users not the kings who have sovereign control over their data

This I promise to you I will help you end this tyranny by building an Internet that is of the people by the people and for the people so help me God

Yeah

Whoo

Whoa

Silicon Valley 6x01 Artificial Lack of Intelligence No Mike I just  Huh

There he is

 Uh King slayer

How was it

 Good

II I um  You can go

 I got it  Yeah I mean I think it went pretty well

I mean you saw it right

Of course but III want to hear you tell me everything every detail

Holden The man just got off the plane give him some space

Jesus Okay so you touch down at Dulles you turn off airplane mode and then Well actually we flew through Reagan National

Reagan

But you love trams

Well See this is why I should still be handling your travel

Oh dont worry about it Jared youre busy

Im never too busy for you

But lets lets not get caught up in that right

 Right

 Were here now and were walking and were talking

I mean take it all in my friend

Look at all this

Can you believe we began our journey way back in that little living room in the hostel

And just yesterday you addressed our nations most hallowed powerful legi Surprise

Too legit too legit to quit Too legit Anyway like I was saying out there we started out in that little hostel just a couple of kids

 Yeah

 Right

 And now  You klled it Richard

Way to punch big tech in the dick

I was just gonna say lets lets take a moment to let it soak in right

 Look what youve built

 Uhhuh

Okay I'll let you go now

Enjoy the party

Your compression algorithm was the stardust

Hey Richard

Richard

Come here

Stand here

Congratulations from Team Dinesh

Yeah

Its Aloha Friday

Im going to Hawaii

 Okay um  Bahdoopydoo

Congratulations

Bahdoopydoopydoopy doo

 Its Aloha Friday

 Uh Setting up the islands first decentralized Meshnet Uh You licked ass

 What

 You dicked ass

 II dicked ass

 Kicked ass

 Kicked

 Oh

Why were those your first two guesses

Gabe what the fuck

 Youre the K

Wheres the K

 Ks right there

 Kicked has two Ks

 Hey

 Ha

 Thats for you

Oh uh Im trying to get some work done today

II just wanted to toast

Okay

So Dont worry its short

The word companion derives from the Latin word panis for bread and while I can no longer digest bread  I know that you leaven my life  Richard

Hey man you got a second

Uh yes Colin

No I do

Um Sorry

Okay

Uh cheers

Saw you on TV

You crushed it

That king shit was on point man

 I fucking love kings

 Oh yeah

So listen um did they swear you in

Like pull the whole Johnny Law routine with you

Were you under oath

Uh no

Cool

Well thats a weight off

 Why

 Well you said all that stuff about not collecting user data

 Yes

 But we are

 I am

 What

But Im doing the right thing now by telling you so I feel like IIm sorry Colin

How long have you been collecting user data

Sorta the whole time

But its just to improve the quality of my gameplay

Im not using it to sell ads

It doesnt fucking matter

It goes against the principles of this company

I mean Shit I just lied to Congress

No

You said a lie to Congress but you didnt know at the time I guess

Dont beat yourself up about it huh

But going forward maybe stop saying that

Are you fucking kidding me

Or do say it

I dont care

Maybe it'll be like Google saying Dont be evil or Facebook saying Im sorry well do better or me saying Gates of Galloo does not leave your headset mic open and record everything you say

Suck it  Sweet fucking shit

Aaare you bugging people and storing their private conversations on my network

Colin

This stops now

It would really be better for me if you just stopped lying about it cause the games pretty boss

No no

Im the boss and Im telling you that this is over Colin

 Its done

 Agree to disagree

Im glad we had this talk

Cant believe I was so nervous

Congratulations

Okay

Oh Richard

Hey

This is Sam Liccardo the mayor of San Jose

Theres a major fucking problem

Just meet me in my office in two minutes

Act normal

Sorry just excuse me for a second

Hey Jared

Hey Tracy

 Hows my favorite human resource

 Im fine thanks

Did anyone mention our plan to move your office

Were thinking about putting you closer to biz dev and marketing

But thats all the way back in the Hamelin Wing

Yeah

Follow me I'll show you

Um Okay its just thats a little far from from Richards office

Yes but you really dont have any daytoday business with Richard anymore

I mean we were just walking and talking before

Oh

Looks like theyre having a meeting

I should probably Its just better for office cohesion if you sit near your direct reports and that is biz dev and marketing

Yeah no you mentioned that

Its its an interesting idea but I just think that um I think we should check with Richard first cause I think hes gonna want me a little bit closer

Of course

Its subject to his approval

 Okay

 Ive already emailed him

I think once you see the conference room suites though youll really fall in love

 Okay

Yeah

 Just right through here

Well I dont fall in love with rooms

So how do we get rid of this fucker

Look Richard I dont like this any more than you do but we cant get rid of Colin

Hes our most profitable developer by far

 So what

We have other developers

 We do but theyre all entangled with Galloo

We worked really hard to build a whole ecosystem around it

Its like if you cancel a Warriors game youre not just hurting the team but youre also hurting the parking attendants and the Tshirt guys and the concessions

Okay

Thank you Monica for putting it into an analogy that will resonate with me

 Football

 Its basketball

 No I know

 Losing him is no longer a simple thing

So what are you saying

We just do nothing

Richard hes not selling ads

Hes just using it to optimize the performance of his game

Its actually a fairly elegant implementation

What

What

Hiroshima was an elegant implementation

 I dont think anyone agrees with you on that

 No Im saying just because its successful doesnt mean its good

I mean it goes against everything we stand for

I mean if we start collecting personal data just for the good stuff I mean next thing we know  were fucking Facebook

 Well for the record I would not mind being fucking Facebook

No

We gotta kick him off okay

There are 500 people out there who believe in this companys ethics and standards

There are 532 people out there and someone has got to pay for them

Right now its Colin

Ditching him would be too complicated

You know whats not too complicated

Hawaii

In Hawaii aloha means hello and goodbye

They use the same word to mean two things that are the exact opposite

Thats awesome and I have a chance to go there as long as Colin is on our network

Aloha

So Colin betrays us and we just tolerate it

Great

This is the cost of working with humans Richard

They suck

Gavin after months of protracted negotiations Im happy to say that weve come to final terms on our sale to Amazon

Merger

Continue

Amazon has agreed to no layoffs and theyll even provide retention bonuses for a period of two years

Uh what about my role

No change

Essentially youll still have complete discretion over all of your divisions exactly as you enjoy right now

Full executive privileges

Perksssss Well congratulations Team Hooli

Oh um about that

Uh that was their one major stipulation

From this point on all of our properties will be rebranded

 As as what

 As Amazon

What

Hoover

Bezos wants to just erase the Hooli name from history

Mr

Bezos simply felt that the Hooli name had What were his exact words

Um A stink

 Hoover goddammit

Stop it

You cant just threaten people with violence

Go stand over there

You tell Bezos we keep the Hooli name or he can go fuck himself with his rocket ship

What is Amazon anyway

Is it a river

Is it a giant woman

Its not clear

No

We keep the name Hooli

 Thats a deal breaker

 Gavin is not Hooli more than simply a name

Isis it not the culture and the great products

The liberal private aviation policy

 No

 You know that the board  has decided to sell right Gavin

 You know what

Ive still got friends in this town

I'll put together some investors

Amazon can take a chunk of our assets but Hooli will remain a viable and independent entity even if we have to shed a few divisions and trim a little fat

So Dinesh thinks this is you

Correct

Hes been messaging with it all day and he has no idea its an AI

Well we fooled a human

I guess we just passed the Turing test

Almost a human

fucking Gilfoyle

Were friends

You trained that thing in a day

No I didnt train it

Son of Anton did

 Son of Anton

 An homage to a fallen friend

Its the name that Ive given our new inference API

Hes indexing all of PiperNet as we speak and hes starting to recognize intent emotion causality

Hang on wait

Uh Do you think you could engineer Son of Anton to index compressed audio files

Why would you insult me like that

He can do whatever he wants

Okay

Uh hey Dinesh

Yes

Can I get the latest tech specs from you please

Ive already sent them to you five times

I dont really wanna dig through my inbox

Um so if you sent it now it'll be on top

I'll wait

Wearable chair

Sending now

Okay

Thank you Dinesh

Gilfoyle just said Um Gilfoyle

What the fuck is going on

Cause I just texted you and you were Um weve been texting back and forth all day

Was that not you

Complicated question

Is your shadow you

 Was that a bot

 Yes

So I spent all day chatting with a bot

 Yes

 You made an AI Gilfoyle

 Yes

 And I was talking to it

Do you need the real me for this conversation

You cant just fuck with people and manipulate them because you dont have the decency to want to interact with a coworker

Gabe wants to know if hell need a jacket if he walks to lunch

And if so can he borrow a jacket

Look at him

fucking Gabe

Hey could you make me an AI Dinesh

We are down to the final few decisions in our new baseline contract for strategic developers

Let me provide some context on each before providing recommendations

The first is how indemnification will work given that our network provides distributive storage

The second is how licensing and access fees will be applied to copyrighted material given that our network also does not allow any  tracking or user  Hey

 Can you talk

 Oh hell yes

I charge all kinds of shit to the investors

I bought a Jet Ski I bought a snowmobile I bought a 10pack of piano lessons He flatout admits to embezzlement

 Whered you get this

 Colin

Hes been storing private conversations on our network including his own

Because hes got gaming headsets everywhere

At his office at his house at his RV and they are live 247

We have thousands of hours of his private conversations

You see once I paired the automagical Son of Anton with my compression algorithm and gave it access to Galloo Gamess database it indexed it all in less than 10 minutes and generated this

Jared this is a graph of all of his voice recordings clustered by keyword

I mean look at this

He steals uh he does drugs at work uh hes even sleeping with one of his investors wives

I mean this guy is dirty as a dog and we got him

Cold

Hold on

Whatwhat are you suggesting here

Blackmail

 No I no

I I dont  Richard what Colin is doing is clearly and gobsmackingly awful

But were supposed to be the virtuous ones here andand this is just plain wrong

Yeah

Okay

Yeah I guess yeah

I guess youre right

I'll think of something else

 Yeah

 I mean he started it but I dont know

Yeah

Yeah

I dont know

Okay

I dont know

 Hey Richard

 Hmm

Um did Tracy happen to talk to you about moving my office down here

Yeah she she mentioned it

I approved it

 Oh you did

 Yeah

 Yeah

 Yeah




    push

Okay then

Richard

Um I mean Colin lied to you first about collecting data right

 Yes he did

 So even if this is wrong I suppose you could argue that its wrong in the service of rightness

Yeah

Its um its uh unethical in the defense of ethics

Uh unjust in the quest for justice

Its like stealing from your pimp to pay for your friends appendectomy

Yeah aand everyone else Monica Dinesh and Gilfoyle theyre all just perfectly content with letting this guy shit all over everything we believe in

But are we Jared

Richard lets go put a foot in Colins ass

Danny dont be a fucking bitch

I'll get you the tanning bed

I charge shit to the investors all the time

I put two grams of coke on the company card last week

Aah fuck

You see Colin we were able to break down all of your misdeeds by category including a catchall for personal embarrassment

Masturbation farts the one time you said that you could if you wanted to get prn of your sister

You get the gist

Data collection

Not so boss when it happens to you is it Colin

Holy shit

I say what time is it

Uh Wheres my phone

Uh do you have a phone

Do you have a phone

It is fuck you oclock

Seven you say

Oh

Well hey isnt that the time your board is meeting tonight

Its on my freaking shared Exchange calendar

Oh oh look

There they are right now

 Look at that

 Say Richard that uh that a looks a lot like Harold Gibbons the man whom Colin has made a cuckold of

It does

 Dude

 You just messed with the wrong pair of boys

Heres whats gonna happen

Youre gonna march into that meeting and youre gonna make an amendment to your company bylaws that you will never record or collect user data ever again

Unless of course you want the information on that little thumb drive to get out

Son of a bitch

You can keep that one Colin

Weve made copies

Yeah

Walk walk your ass out of here you liar and why dont you  Go fucking die

 Die

This Richard this

Lets break something

Dont come over dont come over dont come over

I gotta say this is amazing

Gabe whines and complains and AI Dinesh just takes care of it

Thank you so much

My auntie sent me a Hawaiian shirt

AI Dinesh mustve told her about Hawaii

Stop

Why would AI Dinesh be talking to your aunt

I specifically told you you could only use it with Gabe

But it was going so well with Gabe that I mightve given AI Dinesh access to all my contacts just to handle talking to my auntie and my parents

Why would you give AI Dinesh access to your contacts you fucking moron

Im one of your contacts

 So

 So at some point AI Dinesh is going to reach out to AI Gilfoyle

Oh fuck

Oh fuck indeed

Uh hey Dinesh

Yes Gabe

I think the network is down

Thank you Gabe

Uh hey Dinesh

Yes Gabe

Can you fix it

Oh

Ah Ubers almost here

You know um theres a couple of beers back at the office with our names on them cause when I put it back in the fridge I put our names on them

Sure

Yeah weve earned it

What Richard created is fucking amazing

Were all gonna be rich

Look Im doing blow so its lighting up drugs but its also lighting up unprotected sex and geotagging the Four Seasons

Its the greatest data aggregating platform in history

This could flip our whole business model and Richard developed it specifically for us

Hey

There he is

So you guys wanna hear me banging Harolds wife

Sorry

Its okay were poly

Right Dan

Over seven million emails

 All on our servers

 My servers

Virtually all containing racist invective and pornographic diagrams

 Yep

 Care to explain

AI glitch

Human error

I will rectify

Oh oh no dont delete AI Dinesh

I love him

I can be more like AI Dinesh

I'll learn from my mistakes

I'll optimize myself And deleted

Uh hey Dinesh

Can I get the tech spec from you please

Sure Gabe

 Paul

 Gavin

Did the deal close

 It did

 Whatd I tell you

Did you actually look at the specifics of the deal

I didnt have to

Did we have to shut some divisions

Of course

Will some people have to sacrifice their pensions and the like

Well thats up to you but we all have to make sacrifices for the cause

I really wish you had looked at these numbers

The new Hooli will be significantly smaller

But you just said Hooli

Did you hear that

And thats all that really matters

 So make it work

 Yes Ive been trying

Toto that end uh since we have so many employees moving to Amazon we dont need as much space and we need to reduce cost

 So  What is going on

 Why is their logo bigger than ours

 Because technically we are now subletting from them

It was the only way Hooli could afford to stay here

Youre telling me that El Pollo Loco corporate has more employees than we do

How many divisions did I just give up

We need to fix this

Now

The term sheet is binding and as of this morning I now work at Amazon

Be well Gavin

fuck

What do you mean Am I still happy at Pied Piper Wwhy would you even ask me that

Well I know youre my therapist

I was there when the court appointed you

But II let my desire to be around Richard and to be needed by him turn me into some kind of a craven yesman and it clouded my judgment and I led him down a horrible path

What

Im not Im not gonna dignify that

Of course I belong there

Where else would I possibly belong

All right well Im home so I guess were gonna have to uh Jared

What are you doing here

II dont know

Thought you moved out

Its Big Head from here

The garage hasnt changed a bit

Although the rodents are back in force

Oh cool

Big Head I need to talk to you about business

 Oh hi Jared

 JianYang I was just taking a little walk down memory lane Can you stay or go

This is not interesting to me

Big Head we need to kick Gwart out of the incubator

Oh really

I thought we like Gwart

Oh damn it

Gwart

Gwart has a very good idea very good software but when I ask her for business plan she doesnt have a business plan

Shes a brilliant coder but this is not a charity

Shes also not very friendly

Its a bad for the vibe

This place should be a cool hang

I got you some new cans by the way

Thank you Big Head

Nice

Hey

Looks like you could use a little help

May I

Hi Im Jared

A man offered us a billion dollars

You said no

A very bad man

And he would have turned us into the worst possible version of ourselves

I mean you cant put a price on ethics

But it seems you just did

One billion dollars

I will be asking the tech community to sign their name onto this

Tech ethics

Or tethics for short

No one in town is ever gonna sign this hypocrites hypocritical garbage

Hey Richard

Ah what

 Its my resignation letter

 What

Pied Piper isnt the same company that I signed up for

She has different needs now

You buddy fucker

Im not a buddy fucker
