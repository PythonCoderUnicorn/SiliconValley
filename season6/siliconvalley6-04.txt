We'll Colin he did take my money

 Now he is leaving your network

 To go where

Oh to the network run by my new friend Laurie Bream

RETCHES

 You guys theres really no other option

 Yes there is

If Hooli wont sell us Foxhole we could just buy Hooli

Big question

How do we buy Hooli

You want this deal to close you bring us the forms get everyones hard signature and then bring them to me

Youre not gonna turn your back on 30 years of making money together are you

I dont want to be in business with any of you people

MONICA HALL Everybodys gathered out there so you should probably say something

Wont they be happy

I freed them from Gavin

Or your company just swallowed theirs and you fired their founder and CEO

RICHARD All we wanted was Foxhole and instead we got all these Hooli people

We really couldnt just fire them sight unseen

Uhuh

Tracy from HR has to do an assessment of each person first then we should can them

Oh hey

I think I know that guy

Uh yeah

DINESH What are you doing

Did you just wave him in

II dont know automatic social shit

Hey Ethan

Uh CHUCKLES

 What are you doing here

 You tell me boss

Uh Ethan was my first manager when I was at Hooli

I didnt know you still worked there

Yeah well we cant all invent middleout compression

Uh anyway II hope I make the cut

Yeah well were having to be creative with the merger so Yeah totally

Thats why I figured I could maybe help

You could use Hooli OS for your entire mobile suite

Yeah were not gonna spend months porting Hooli software over to our protocol so  But thanks

 Yeah it was a good thought

Yeah you wouldnt have to

When we iterated Hooli OS 11 we reengineered the entire network layer to be compatible with other protocols and you own it

How quickly would you say you could um make it work with PiperNet

A few weeks with almost zero refactor

How much money do you think that could save us

So you guys are planning to build your own external antennas to deploy for the Hawaii test

 Why

 The zerostart problem

Until we have a critical mass of users iOS and Android devices dont have enough range

Right of course not but pushtotalk HooliPhones do

DINESH HooliPhones

You want us to roll out our network on pushtotalk  jankyass HooliPhones

 LAUGHS MOCKINGLY

Laugh it up but uh the fact that they still have low power omnidirectional antennas means they have a radius of four miles

What is your antennas range

 One mile

 GILFOYLE Wrong

Onepointonefive

Okay

Line of sight though

 Maybe

 Richard you guys just bought 250000 HooliPhones

Instead of spending more money on expensive and mediocre antennas why not just give away HooliPhones for the test

Delete

RICHARD You know Ethan could you walk us through the Hooli OS side of all this work

Yeah totally but I think itd go faster if I just took point and your guys backed me up

Im sorry what do you mean back you up

Guys we are in a huge hole here

Whatever it takes to get us out of it please

Um why dont you talk to Tracy in HR and you can get your startpaperwork

Cool

Looks I already earned my keep huh Patches

LAUGHS

Patches

Yeah

Oh thats weird that you remember that

Um so Patches

I'll tell them

Uh first day at Hooli I wore this sweater that had these like elbow pads on it

 Anyway uh  HooliPhones

Are you fucking serious

You just laid down and let that guy roll all over us

Look I dont wanna use Hooli shit anymore than you guys but this is for the greater good of the company

This will get us to a working test

This will get us to Hawaii

Hey

THEME SONG PLAYING

Silicon Valley 6x04 Maximizing Alphaness  Thank you

 Mmhmm

Oh Laurie

This will be sound

Excuse me one minute

 Laurie

 Oh Monica

 Hello

 Hi

Im now using touch as a means to communicate friendship

Uhhuh

Hey um is that Kara Swisher

What do guys do in there

We are uplifting each other while we plan our annual Women in Tech Empowerment panel

Karas moderating

Oh my God

Is that Susan Susan Wojcicki from YouTube

Dont point its unseemly

SIGHS

Laurie you do know that I am the CFO of a prominent tech company and just personally led  the acquisition of Hooli

 Yes I am aware

My partner Maximo is hmm unpleased

Im just saying II would love to do the panel

Why

You dont mentor you dont volunteer you dont develop programs for women

Youve never shown the slightest interest in supporting women

Of course I have

Which is why I wanna do your panel with Susan Wojcicki from YouTube

We'll we do have a lot of funny people

You could add balance

Are you eating the entire leaf

Its amazing how wasteful people in the West can be

GAVIN Hoover

This book will send shockwaves throughout the Valley

Cold Ice Cream and Hot Kisses

This is about your experience at Hooli

No no

Its a comingofage story about a lost yet handsome teen growing up one fateful summer in Maine

Now get that to the publishers

I want the hardback in my hand by tomorrow lunchtime

Sir it takes a bit longer than that

We have to send it out to publishing houses and then find an editor

Editors are for people who cant write correctly the first time

We'll selfpublish

And this really isnt about tech

No

Ive left tech for good

Now I have a chance to do something important

Write a thinly veiled roman Ãƒ clef set in a whalethemed B and B

RICHARD So look Monica um I was looking over the org chart and I think Im gonna put you in charge of Foxhole

 What

 Yeah

I mean while I know that you and I were saying that maybe some people might find it a little misogynist or offensive

I think that we if we had a woman at the helm it might change the optics and since you dont really care No III do care

I care deeply

No you dont

I mean you literally said If a bunch of dumb Marines wanna cheat on their dumb wives what the fuck do I care I dont think I used those exact words

Im pretty sure you did actually

 You texted it to me last night see

 No but And then you also said We dont have to smell it

We just have to sell it

 As long as those fat fat fatties  Okay

And they live in Santa Cruz

And theyre still together

What should I do

Okay

Cool uh guilty as charged

Big cake lover

You got me

We'll I mean I was your boss for a year so you know I have some funny photos of you squirreled away right

Uh I didnt know that was a thing bosses did but yeah maybe

Speaking of which did you write that

 MAN Ooh

 WOMAN LAUGHING Oh my God

GABE And sorted list size is greater than  plus plus index

 LAUGHING

You ran a brute force search on a sorted list

Look guys it was my first day and  I was nervous and I was hurrying so  ETHAN Really

Thats why you decided to write the slowest subroutine in history

LAUGHING

Anyone couldve made that mistake

Yeah its true

In fact I could ask for a show of hands but instead of doing that uh I'll just uh  Could you have made that mistake

 LAUGHING

Could you have made that mistake

Could you have made that mistake

 Okay

 Could you have made that mistake

The joke is that hes doing a brute force search of the room

 Yeah I know

 Then why did you do it

 LAUGHTER CONTINUING

 ETHAN Could you have made that mistake

Richard what the fuck was that

It was just Ethan being Ethan

He was acting like your boss and you were acting like his noob employee

No

Everyone knows Im the boss

I think people were just excited to you know razz the CEO

 Its all in good fun

 I did not have fun

I watched you get kicked in the balls for 90 minutes

My balls hurt sympathetically for your balls

Take off that sweater

Its fine

I mean yes Ethan can be a little prickly but he is gonna get us to where we need to be

And I dont mind putting my ego aside for the good of the company

That guy humiliating you was not good for the company

He dominated you like a silverback gorilla

Do you know why the gorillas respected Jane Goodall

 Jane Goodall studied chimpanzees

 Wrong

Its because she could kick their ass and they knew it

You need to assert dominance like Jane Goodall

I have something to show you

Youre gonna need this

We'll I have had my eye on you for a while now

Its what I like to call mentoring from a distance

We havent spoken more than five words to each other since you joined the company

Thats the distance part

Look II came here to talk about advancing the careers of women specifically yours

 Do you know how we just acquired Foxhole

 Of course

Apparently its 90 men and almost all the female users are prostitutes

Which makes it a very challenging assignment

Its also a big promotion and strategically important to the company

And its yours if you want it

But I mean if you dont think you can handle it I can just check in with Becky Nadia  Dani  No

 I can do it

Would you ask John Grisham the same question or Jackie Collins

We'll no but they werent the head of a failed tech company

You think I failed

I didnt fail tech

Tech failed me

Tech failed all of us

Look

We should be in a Waldenbooks but were here in this decrepit shthole and why

Because people buy books online thanks to Hool Amazon

So dont point fingers at me

I didnt write about tech because tech destroys worlds and I I wanted to create them

THUMPS

May I have a token for the restroom please

We'll theres not a whole lot to the story

Once you came along Susan and I realized the timing was not right and we needed to give you up

We had our fun but maybe stop all the jokes about my coding mistake from years ago and also stop calling me Patches

Yeah

Okay

Butt Stuff

LAUGHS

You remember that

When you walked around all day and your Tshirt was stuck all the way into your underwear all day

I mean I remember it but no to Butt Stuff

 Um just call me Richard

 Heres the thing

That name makes me happy and if you had as much managerial experience as I do youd know that keeping your star coder happy is how you get the best work and you guys need me to do really good work because Im kind of the only person here that can do it so Im just gonna keep calling you Patches

Is that okay with you

Patches

 Oh

 RICHARD Aw

So its complicated

You were the clear aggressor in this incident but youre also the only one who got hurt

You hit him in the forehead which is the single hardest part of the human body

I would never advocate violence but when you make a fist you wanna keep your thumb on the outside

Yeah

Uh I know that now but at the time I couldnt remember

RON You did great Champ but heres the bottom line

We gotta cool our shit down with this guy before he lawyers up and sues us a new hineyhole

You need to go talk to Ethan and give him a sincere  and honest apology

 Without admitting any fault or describing what happened in any way

JARED I asked myself why would they reject me and not their three other biological children

 And that is when it hit me

 SIMON GAME BEEPING

Its me

I mean even as a baby I must have somehow rejected them and every subsequent foster family Ive ever had

Oh

Heavy

I rejected Richard and every person who has ever offered me safe harbor and it has to stop

I have to commit to Gwart

No matter how difficult it gets even if were miserable together I am going to support her work and bring her food andand put her in her prescription sleeping bag when she starts to thrash

It is the only path forward

Hey thats the best man

I feel like you made a lot of progress

 Ha

 SIMON GAME BEEPING

Gwarts doll gloves

Im gonna make her so happy

My book is a fucking disaster

SIGHS

What have you got there

Oh um MSNBC wanted to interview you about being an antitech evangelist

Their words

I told them you only wanted to speak about two things cold ice cream and hot kisses

Whowho was it

Was it Hayes or ODonnell

Maddow sir

 Really

 Yes

Im sure all the major outlets would love to have you if you discuss tech

So SIGHS

Do I honor my truth as a starving author or do I return to the world Ive scorned

Publishers Weekly is a terrible magazine sir

Call Maddow

Its gonna be a very hard act to follow but here to try is Monica Hall the CFO of Pied Piper

Come on up Monica

APPLAUDING

 Thank you for coming Monica

 Thank you

I was thrilled and surprised to be invited

So lets cut right to the chase

You recently acquired Hooli and one of its properties is Foxhole which is apparently an app that military members use to source prostitutes

Yes and thats something Im not involved with on any level

Its being run now by a young woman I promoted Priyanka Singh

I talked to Priyanka before this panel

Priyanka are you in this audience

 Yes hi

 Hey Priyanka

How you doing

Why dont you get up and tell us about it

CLEARS THROAT

We'll when I first took over the app I was pretty lost but luckily I was able to call on my network of strong female coders

CHEERING

And almost immediately we came up with a plan to rebuild Foxhole from the bottom up

Our first step will be to unionize the sex workers on the app

We believe that friends with benefits deserve benefits because sex work is work

APPLAUDING

And

And

Why is it only for men

Dont our female soldiers who put their bodies in harms way deserve to put their bodies in pleasures way

CHEERING

I think it might be a good idea to bring Priyanka up here

 Priyanka why dont you come up

 Uh okay

APPLAUDING

SWISHER So Priyanka the business of sex positive feminism Monica move

Like we say at Foxhole if you can scale Tinder you can scale sex positive feminism

 APPLAUSE

 Theres a seat in back

Ethan

Hey um I owe you an apology

Its bad enough that I used brute force to search a sorted list but No Richard
