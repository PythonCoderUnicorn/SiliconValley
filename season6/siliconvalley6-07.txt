  AUDIENCE CHEERING

 Middleout was a game changer

 SCREAMS

 ANNOUNCER The winner of this year is Pied Piper

What you have to understand is conventional compression  was like rubbing two sticks together

 And along comes Pied Piper out of nowhere with a frickin blowtorch

We'll we had really just started um a few months earlier and like a bunch of other Silicon Valley companies we were just working out of a garage

Or a house really

 DOCUMENTARIAN Nice place

 No

DINESH It was like a shit hole but there was so much shit in it  it was filled all the way up

  So it was like level with the ground

 If thats true there was a little meniscus  in the shit and thats where  our dreams lived

Not the kind of house you wanna take your shoes off in

 Yeah just fuckin smelled really bad

  It was all right

 JARED Oh I was the sloppy girl in the discotheque just twirling and twirling like the night would never end

JianYang won the house from me in a game of chance

He told me to pick a number between one and 10

I picked seven um but it was three

Eh you live you learn

We had knocked around for a few years trying different iterations of what we wanted to do

It was at RussFest when things really got crazy for us

PARTY CHAT&TER

Hey

There you are

I uh got you something

Oh Monica

CHUCKLE

Leaving AT&T

Just dotted the Is crossed the Ts and every single detail is perfect

 I sent this to you last week

 Yeah and as soon as you did I knew I had to frame it

We'll I mean I had my assistant frame it but you know

Its really awesome

Although Are you sure this is what I sent to you

 Yeah

Why

 Okay

No here

Huh

Thats weird

Oh its because Its actually kinda funny

 Um Im not sure if you  JIANYANG Richard congratulations

Its your very close friend JianYang and I would like you to give me free shares of Pied Piper

CHUCKLE

Okay JianYang

Uh We'll you had plenty of opportunity to invest

 Still do

 Yeah you can buy Pipercoin

Monica two men are talking business

You can find your broom and fly away

Suit yourself

I just checked the ledger and the coin we issued to Erlich was just sold for 20 million

Richard is the mean lady right

Errich is now fat and rich

Uh yeah I guess

Where is he

I dont know

Tibet still maybe

Okay

Tibet

Okay

 RICHARD Huh

 DOCUMENTARIAN So at this point steaming into the launch you had no idea  what was about to happen

 No

No none

None whatsoever

Everything was going great

DINESH What the fuck is wrong with Richard

Why does he wanna see us so early

We'll hes been here all night

He wouldnt explain but he is in a bit of a state

 Hey Richard

 MARKER SQUEAKING

Richard theyre here

Oh great

Yeah

Sit sit

Sit sit

 DINESH Why

 Just find a seat

 Richard whats wrong

 RICHARD I dont know

Maybe nothing

Maybe something

Look here I wanna show you something

Um You see

Okay

So uh this was a message I sent to Monica last week

She had it framed for me as a gift

Oh I was gonna get you a gift but um it was backordered so its coming next Look at the dots

Count the dots

 Dots

 The dots

Look look

Every single detail is dotdotdot perfect

Okay

There are three dots in that ellipsis which is the correct number of dots

However in the message that I sent her there are four dots which is incorrect

Thus not perfect

It was a joke

 Was it

 Yes

Was and is

LAUGH

Okay well uh I didnt change your joke Richard

Thats what I got

Three dots

LAUGH

Wait is it three dots thats funny or is it four

RICHARD Four four four

Thats what I sent her four

But our messaging is encrypted

So how did what I send four dots end up as three dots in her feed

Data corruption bit flip  just a fluke

 Yeah sure

Yeah thats what I thought

So then I checked the logs read the math

The total size of all sent messages should be the same as the total size of all received messages right

But its not

The received messages are smaller

How

How is that possible

Unless our network is compressing the content of encrypted files in transit

And the only way that is possible is by bypassing encryption

 We'll thats impossible

 RICHARD I agree

It makes no sense but dont you think we should figure this out before launch

Richard dont do this

Not now

We launch in four days

The TV spots are already running

Were not jeopardizing billions of dollars because youre missing a dot

Should I get everyone in here to start working on this

 We'll  GILFOYLE Were beyond that

The others cant help us now

Jared bolt the doors

Whats in the bag

Clif bars and a gn

GAVIN BELSON SIGH

May I be honest

There was a period of my life in which I wouldve rooted for the failure of Richard Hendricks

That was a different Gavin Belson

That was  tech icon Gavin Belson  not literary icon Gavin Belson

Since leaving Hooli Ive coauthored 37 adult romance novels

Fondly Margeaux

The Lighthouse Dancer

Cold Ice Cream and Hot Kisses

Over here The Prince of Puget Sound

Uh and lastly His Hazel Glance

All international best sellers

Uh GGavin

A moment please

SIGH

Im so sorry

A moment

GAVIN The fuck is your problem

ROD MORGENSTERN You said that this would be an hour

GAVIN We'll were just running a little over

ROD Yeah with the lights and the machines and the sound equipment how is this ever gonna be an hour

GAVIN Youre acting hysterical all right

We'll have plenty of time to write this ROD Yeah you know what

You know what

Do your your little interview

I'll just write the book myself okay

GAVIN We'll if you could you would but you cant

Youre stuck with me and Im stuck with you

ROD Whoa whoa whoa Thats what Florian says to Claudette outside the cheese cave

 GAVIN Oh my God

Thats our third act

 ROD Third act

 GAVIN Yes

Okay go put the kettle on

 ROD Yeah

Im terribly sorry

Im gonna have to cut this short

Thank you for coming

When Richard told me about the dots last night initially I dismissed it as the ranting of a selfsabotaging idiot

But a few hours later when I woke up in a stall in the second story mens bathroom I realized something

That youre an alcoholic

Perhaps but highfunctioning

Much like our network

To wit TYPING

Our internal messaging based on HooliChat uses a weak encryption standard known as P256

Whether Richard believes it or not our network cracked it

Who allowed it to do that

GILFOYLE We did when we gave it one job

To make itself more efficient

It developed a general solution to discrete log in polynomial time

What

JARED Okay is this a good thing or a bad thing

Someone tell me how to feel

Abject terror for you

Build from there

GILFOYLE Once launched our AI will keep learning to break more and more sophisticated parameters

Ultimately this will mean the end of privacy

Electrical grids financial institutions the nuclear launch codes for every single nuclear weapon

All will be exposed

Pure violence will become the only basis of power

Spare us the apocalyptic desert planet scifi bullshit Frank Herbert

Uh Frank Herbert was a writer who wrote a series of I know who fucking Frank Herbert is

Oh

Im sorry

Was that gendered

 That was gendered

 RICHARD Okay Gilfoyle

Even if everything youre saying is right and thats where were headed theres gotta be a way to fix it

Fix what Richard

The network is doing exactly what we told it to do

The AI is optimizing the compression and the compression is optimizing the AI

Everything that makes it successful is exactly what makes it dangerous

Its a feature not a bug

No SCOFF no no

Okay no

What are we gonna do about it

What do you suggest we do about it

Youre gonna make me say it arent you

Fine

We built a monster

We need to kll it

 DINESH fuck

 Are you out of your mind

No no no no no Gilfoyle

We didnt build a monster first of all

We built the single greatest fucking network ever in the world

Thats the big one

And Im sorry you wanna kll it

Now

Now

Now

We are inches away from the finish line

You wanna fucking kll it

We did it man

We built it

It works

It just needs a little help

We just gotta fix it okay

We dont kll it

Thats crazy man

kll yourself is the thing

fuck you

I mean thats crazy

When people ask me about Pied Piper I always tell them the same thing

 SOFT GRUNTING

 Are there other questions

Uh yeah

Can you elaborate

Mm yes

QUIET PRISON CHAT&TER

Will you

Ah Hmm SIGH

Save it Jared

Im not in the mood for a pep talk

You know if I learned anything from my time with Gwart its the power of just listening

fucking Gilfoyle

Shut it down

Are you fucking kidding me

Throw everything away that weve been working toward

Not to mention the fact that we have a contract worth billions of dollars

Yeah thats a lot of money

And what about all the other stuff were gonna do

I mean give internet to underserved communities students in the homework gap refugees genomic research

Pied Piper can help scientists cure cancer

 And cancer is bad

 Cancer fuckin sucks

Hey Id like some cancer please

No

And we have this beautiful baby who is a little sick But apparently its now the devil and we have to kll it

I vote we take it to the doctor but fuck

I had a foster mother who thought I was the devil and that she had to kll me

And I think it was pretty traumatizing for her

And ththe odds of Gilfoyles stupid crazy doomsday scenario actually coming true are I mean weve had a nuclear arsenal for decades and were fine

I mean outside of a couple substantial blips

Two in particular

Id say were safer

The real killer is stress

Okay sure fine

Oppenheimer famously said he regretted building the atom bmb and died in despair but what the fuck does that have to do with anything

Oppenheimer

What a selfobsessed little bitch

What are we supposed to do huh

What are we supposed to do

fucking Gilfoyle

We'll just call up AT and say that our network is so good that it'll eventually become some doomsday device and we have no moral option but to destroy it before we let you release it

I mean Were not doing it

Were not

 Were not

 Hey Richard

Whatever you think is best thats what were gonna do

I mean they just put up the billboard

Shes a beauty right

Fu 

Sorry guys

 Gilfoyles right

 Seriously

Were seriously doing this

Were canceling the launch

We'll no

Uh ha thats not enough

Our network is dangerous

If we cancel it or shut it down then others will try to copy or reverse engineer everything that weve built

Its like Its like the fourminute mile

Everybody thought it was impossible until someone did it and then everybody started doing it because they knew it could be done

JARED Right

Roger Bannister

Now imagine hed gone into cardiac arrest and evacuated on himself and died

And as he lay there with his prolapsed anus peeking beneath the running shorts on his newly dead body the crowd jeered and grimaced

That is what has to happen to us

We have to shit ourselves to death

Mmhmm

Mmhmm

Hes right

Our launch has to fail publicly and spectacularly

Are you dumbfucks listening to yourselves

Because I am and you are dumb

And fucks

Gilfoyle is willing to destroy everything weve built just to prevent me from having money

BEEPING

Interesting

Is that Dineshs Tesla

What

 Theres no one in it

 GILFOYLE Correct

You have the Tesla mobile app on your phone which communicates over the Pied Piper network

A few hours ago I tasked said network with providing me your TLS encryption key which it just gave me

To verify that that key was correct I decided to autodrive your car to the car wash on El Camino

It appears the key was correct  no

 REVVING

Be careful Charlotte

What encryption does Tesla use

Curve 25519 the most secure discrete log parameter there is

Not anymore

Our network just blew it apart like a prolapsed anus

In only two hours and 47 minutes

 The prosecution rests

 MONICA Okay Dinesh theyre right

We have to fail and it has to look like an accident or else we could all go to prison

 No I cannot do it

 GILFOYLE Of course you can

Your entire life has prepared you to publicly fail

Youre just failing to see that right now

Dont insult me

I can fail circles around you losers

But will I

Im gonna be honest with you

No offense to me but I am greedy and unreliable bordering on piece of shit

If there is a chance to stop you guys from stopping you guys I will do it

I will sabotage your sabotage

So if this company needs to fail epically like fucking fail you need to do it without me

Revoke my permissions

Delete my PiperMail account

I will use Gmail like a fucking basic bitch

SIGH

Dont let me anywhere near that launch

I may beg and I will lie to you

I cannot bribe you because I dont have any money

But I am too much of a liability

That is the most courageous act of cowardice Ive ever seen

All this because of a fucking dot

Dineshs car is at the Wendys drivethru

Anybody hungry

They call it PiperNet and its coming to your phone

Tomorrow at noon the Pied Piper app will go live on the latest 5Gequipped iOS and Android phones in 10 major cities across the country

AT&T says if things go as planned PiperNet could be on more than a half billion devices within a year

And no one is more excited than technology super fans  like the ones behind me  CHEERING

who are camping out all night to snag a limited edition Pied Piperequipped smartphone

I cannot verify this because Im not at a supernode

Im across the stage from you as you can see

But Dinesh is

Hes on the roof

He wants me to give him back his permissions to deploy

DINESH So I can push out the right build

The wrong The build guys

The build we talked about

The build that saves the world but makes me poor

Question is do we believe him

In fairness there are a lot of reasons not to trust him such as he told us not to trust him

 DINESH Believe me

 But do we trust that

DINESH For once I wanna do the right thing

GILFOYLE Richard Im gonna need an answer

 I dont have much time

 The fate of the world literally relies on this

Problem

We havent raised the noise far enough to drown out even Bluetooth

Okay so were generating noise but just not enough to interfere with anything

DINESH Is this gonna work

Did we just make billions of dollars

This wouldnt be happening if we had had time to test things

 fucking kidding me

We failed at failing

 DOGS BARKING

Wait why are they barking

 BARKING

They literally became the Pied Piper

I mean you cant make that up

ROD Yeah maybe you couldnt but I could

Oh for fucks sake

When you think about a lot of the failures in tech Pets

com Theranos WeWork Pied Piper really is right at the top of that list

Pied Piper is just a millstone around AT&Ts neck

I say dump it

Dump it now

I lost so much fucking money with those guys

 I got ratfucked

 Thats a pun

I made it all back though

Sweet investment in the hair transplant sector

What

Rats ah yes we have some of them here

Figuratively

They are dealt with

And so effective immediately I am shutting down Pied Piper deleting its code repositories and liquidating its remaining assets

All right

Thats our statement

We will not be taking any further Can I just say that I am just truly deeply sorry

Uh this should never have been built

It is technically flawed to its very core

And we should all remember that forevermore

Sorry

REPORTERS SHOUTING QUESTIONS

Obviously Mr

Hendricks doesnt mean that in any legally binding or actionable way

Get a life guys

Its weird

It really seemed like Pied Piper was going to work

Something doesnt add up

DINESH So I did the right thing I helped save the world my legs are still super sore and my reward is that Im poor

What are you gonna do

Not sure

Been thinking about teaching No not you

Oh uh I think I might disappear for a bit

Maybe travel

Yeah I might travel too

Where were you thinking

It may help if at least for the time being you pretend to be mad at me

Look Richard I was a world theater minor at Vassar but that is one Javanese shadow play that I cannot perform

PAPER TEARING

Not out loud but  You know

 Silence is on brand for me

Good luck Dinesh
