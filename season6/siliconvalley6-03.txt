At this point I could stand to be a little perverted

Yeah I wanna be a lot perverted

We'll be profitable and up 5X inside three years

Youve got three months

 What is this

 My resignation letter

Laurie what are you doing here

Ive made myself the CEO of the OwlNet

This is who youre walking away for

 This George R R

 No no no

No

 Oh my god

 You did this Richard

Cheers to our future endeavors together

We will not mine user data

I was very clear about that

If you do not take my money Richard it will be very bad for you

 A billion dollars

 Yes

A man offered us a billion dollars and you said no

A very bad man and he wouldve turned us into the worst possible version of ourselves

I mean you cant put a price on ethics

But it seems you just did

One billion dollars

Monica you were okay with this

YYes

Richard do you remember when you turned down 10 million from Gavin Belson

Did that start some sick addiction to turning down money

Are you just chasing that dragon you sick junkie fuck

Now Dinesh look if Id taken that 10 million you wouldnt own two and a half percent of everything weve built here

Two and a half percent of a billion dollars is 25 million

Yes but actually the billion dollars was to own ten percent of the company

So not to split hairs you would uh technically be worth 250 million

 fuck

 Huh

At an interest rate of 3

65 percent leaving a billion dollars in the bank would get you 36

5 million a year

Thats a hundred grand a day

Thats  Sixtynine dollars a minute

 Sixtynine dollars a minute

Think about all the gold chain you couldve bought with that money

I actually dont think that interest rate is accurate because  even a 30year Tbill is only  Twopointnine percent

 Twopointnine

 All your blathering just now wouldve made us 2 32

Again II dont think thats right because assuming an APR of three I cost us well under two dollars so its not even Um sorry uh  Hello

 Richard

Its Maximo

We are on the phone

How are you

Yeah I know

Im fine

We were just talking about you myself and Colin

 Colin

 Oh yes

Colin is here

He is making the peace sign to you

Now you remember how you refused to take my money

We'll Colin he did take my money

So now he is leaving your network

Wait to go where

Oh to the network run by new friend Laurie Bream

Now you remember when I said if you did not take my money it would be very bad for you

We'll let me tell you what is going to happen to you next

Which was too too too much for her so she went down 51st Street to see Dr

X who gave her eight pills which left her Boobless

Silicon Valley 6x03 Hooli Smokes

 So Colins out

 Yes

So our profits are zero

Its worse than that

Maximo has bought all of Lauries Pied Piper shares as well as all the shares of Big Heads dad

He now owns 30 percent of the company

So the only way we can raise money to stay alive is by selling shares but the second we do that Maximo buys them

Yeah and when he gets a majority stake he can do whatever he wants

Shut us down fire all of us take our IP to Laurie to use on her network

Hes starving us out

 How long can we survive

 We'll the Siege of Candia lasted 21 years

Oh

We'll thats something

It ended in 1669 when the Ottoman soldiers were infected with plague after being attacked with the liquid from the spleens and buboes of the dead

Whats a bubo

Plagueinfested lymph nodes

So they would like scoop them out and throw them at people

fuck

fuck

Richard did you just try to punch the wall and miss

Nope

I clipped it

I got it

Sort of like that

I see

So until a Richard Hendricks reports an assault II technically cant turn myself in for it

That is correct

And what about a restraining order

Can II take one out against myself on his behalf

No

What if I threaten you guys

Just hear me out fucking pigs

II hope that you get cheated out of your overtime

How about that dickless

Maybe you could just try calling the guy

Why were you talking to the police

Oh it was just a personal issue

You should not bring them here

fuck the police

JianYang youre not doing anything illegal here are you

Yes

Where is everyone

Jared is bringing chaos to the house and chaos is bad for our business

Yeah

What is our business

I told you its a better for both of us if you do not know

Oh right

Yeah

We need to get rid of Gwart

Its the only way to get rid of Jared

Gwart

Yes

Richard

 Gavin

 You look like shit

So do you

What happened to your hand

I punched a wall

Cool

Want a drink

Dont you think its a little early Its kombucha with ginseng and lemongrass Richard

Im not a fucking hobo

All I wanted to do was be a golden millionaire

Is that too much to ask

A millionaire that gets peed on

I could see you making half that happen

No you have as many millions as your age

I mean everyone in the Valley is swimming in money

Why not me

I believe your people have a concept for it

 Karma

 Firstly I am Muslim from Pakistan you fucking racist

Secondly karma does not exist

Otherwise it would mean that bad things happen to me because Im a bad person

Check and check

Oh Im a bad person

Says the guy who literally worships Satan

I am a great guy

In my youth I wouldve argued that life is just a series of random events devoid of any meaning

But as a data scientist I have to recognize that sometimes patterns emerge

Undeniable patterns

Get right with the universe

Dinesh

 Yo

 Hey

What is up my cousin

 Oh

 Hey uh Gilfoyle  you remember my cousin Wajeed

 Yes

Coz I have been meaning to call you

Remember last year when you wanted to sell all those shares of Bro that I gave you

And I was like dont sell those shares

And you were like I need the money to buy floor mats for my Tesla so I can make a guy named Danny in the office feel bad

Good memory

Um but you know Bro was basically out of business

It was

But so wild

After you sold those shares I sold Bro to MoveShack for basically nothing and yesterday MoveShack got acquired by Snapchat and uh we crushed it

 How much did you make

 Oh you wont believe this Sixty million dollars

Yes 60 million dollars

Im a golden millionaire

Times two

So Dinesh sold his shares and then your fortunes turned around

Is that right

Huh

Weird

Its just like that time

Remember you me and Ali we went down to play by the river  Oh Boring story

 and then and then Dinesh you snuck home so that you could get Alis jump rope and play with it by yourself without telling him and then Ali and I found a giant giant box of British candy

You love candy

Oh it was the best

Anyway Im a golden millionaire

How about I buy drinks yeah

 Karmas a  Youre a bitch

Anyway the fucking US government blocked the entire thing

Can you believe that

I pay taxes

 I mean I dont but  Yeah

But look I mean I think were even more fucked than you are

Were quite a pair arent we

To us

To the men in the arena living or dying under the watchful gaze of Caesar

Are you not entertained

Its uh from Jared Dunn

Do you remember him

Of course

Hows he doing

Actually uh funny enough he just bailed on me to go work for some sexy new startup back at my old hacker hostel

Ironic

Exactly the same way he left me for you

Jared always had an eye for talent

Thanks I guess

So what was the munition that CIFIUS got on your case for

Some kind of  illegal hacking tool

 You wanna hear the worst part

Its a fucking dating app called Foxhole

 An app

 Yep

I cant shut it down because my investors will lose their shit and I cant sell it because who the fuck wants something  with all those restrictions on it

 Right

Anyway Heres to us the Shackletons  betrayed by natures cruelest whims  Wait

 her wants  Sorry just If I owned Foxhole wouldnt that prevent this Chilean guy from buying more of my shares

Actually it would go even further

Hed have to sell all the shares he already owns

Okay so um if you sell me Foxhole I mean that would certainly save my ass obviously but it would also save yours because then you could move your operations wherever you wanted

I mean its kind of perfect right

It would benefit us both equally

 Holy shit

 Yeah

Um look Gavin I know we always havent seen eyetoeye were not the best of friends but this may be a chance to actually help each other out right

What do you say

I mean isnt it obvious

I say no

 What

 No

fuck no Richard

I cant make a move that would benefit you

Youre my competition

Help no rival

Its one of the basic principles of business

We just spent the last hour bonding about how this business is comprised of backstabbers and cutthroats

Yes exactly

Thats what this is

Its a little weird you dont get it

I could help you Gavin

You already have Richard

I mean I was sitting up here feeling totally just impotent and then you came along and exposed your underbelly and practically begged me to plunge the knife in

I mean I still have a deep hole to crawl out of but this is a fucking great start

Look at that

It barely hurts anymore

We'll if youll excuse me I have a triathlon to train for and Im suddenly feeling a wellspring of energy

Look Richie youre basically outta options

So what are you saying

That I just lay down and die

I take issue with your definition of die my dude

I can get that Chilean cat on the phone right now and get you paid

Theres no shame in it

Musk built PayPal and sold

Hoffman built LinkedIn and sold

You seen those guys lately

I dont care about the money thats not why I got into this

Richie can I be honest with you for once

For once

Youre my attorney

You remember the end of Thelma and Louise

How they drove that car off the cliff

Why

That was a mint 66 TBird

They didnt need that car to get over the cliff

Whyd that car have to die

II think it had something to do with um  womens rights or something

 Important stuff

But sorry whats your point

My point Richie is you wanna go over the cliff Thelma thats fine

All right

You do you

But you gotta remember there are 500 other people in the trunk that are gonna burst into flames with you

And for what

Computers

Thats Jared

Hes been calling me all day

Uh hey can I call you back

Im in the middle of something

Did you talk to Gavin Belson about Gwarts company and call her sexy

Uh what

No

I mean yes but I barely mentioned it

Did you call her sexy

Yes or no

I think I was more talking about her tech

So you told Gavin Belson a lion in repose that Gwart was a potential threat and now JianYang is selling us to him for pocket change

 JianYang can do that

 Yeah

He owns 60 percent of the company

He can do whatever he wants

Gavin is shutting us down Richard

Gwart is so mad she wont even look at me

 Aah fuck

 You know if you want revenge on me thats fine

But to go after Gwart

She doesnt have your savvy or your ruthlessness Richard

Hell she has to wear earplugs on hikes because the forest is too loud

Look I was only talking to Gavin to save Pied Piper

II had no idea he was A monster

Of course you did

Thats all you talked about for years

Gavin is a monster

Poor Pied Piper

Im Richard Hendricks

I dont think my voice is that deep

I mean who is the buddyfucker now

You are the buddyfucker

So we gonna save that TBird or are we gonna take her right over the cliff

So uh look II know its not a billion dollars but um given the situation its actually a very good deal

Do you want to sell the company

No I dont

Dinesh I dont but Ron is right

Maximo is getting it no matter what

Why just give it away

Right

Yeah

Look anyway you guys have done everything Ive asked for so uh you all deserve this

We'll we can take the money and still be good people right

Plus Richard is the CEO so I have to follow his orders

I mean no ones ever been a bad person cause they followed orders right

You guys theres really no other option

 Yes there is

 What

No

Okay if Hooli wont sell us Foxhole we could just buy Hooli

Right

Yeah

Thethe same way we can buy America and everything in it

No IIm serious

We just found out how much Hoolis worth and its not that much

Sorry how do we know how much Hoolis worth

Gavin bought Gwarts company using Hooli stock

Mmhmm

And when he did he tipped his hand

He really ran it into the ground

Yeah and Maximos offers so strong that our price just shot up

Holy shit

Were worth more than Hooli

Uh hey Jared uh  thank you for  Save it

Im not doing this for you

Im doing it for Gwart

The second you own Hooli you release us to become independent nonnegotiable

Of course

Sure yeah

If thats what you want

Cool

So guys are we really doing this

fuck it

Yeah

I think we have to

We have to sleep on it

Okay

Were gonna buy Hooli

Big question  how do we buy Hooli

 We'll in order to get the cash we have to sell a chunk of our shares to someone other than Maximo and I mean whoever we rope into that is gonna lose a fortune

 Because 

 We'll wed be selling to them at our current high price

And when we acquire Hooli and Foxhole CIFIUS will force Maximo to dump all his shares and our valuation will plummet

And I couldnt do that to anyone

Oh

Couldnt you

Yeah IIm not sure I could do it either

Okay

Deal breaker then right

Cause theres no one I could do that to either

Oh isnt there bro

Oh God damn it

You want me to be an investor in your company

 I do

 Wow thatthat is so cool

But I dont know why Im surprised because youre literally the greatest guy that I know

 What

 Yeah

I mean literally last week Farooq was calling me and he was like Hey you know whos a good guy And I was like My cousin Dinesh And he was like Yes

Yes your cousin  Dinesh

 Thats me

Its hard for me to say but II think we should hang out more okay

And thats my fault and I promise that I will call you as soon as me and my friends get back

Where you guys going

Oh were just gonna go down to the North Shore because I bought 80 acres in Hawaii bro

And the beach is like pretty private or whatever but theres like fashion shoots and supermodels Just sign it

Thank you triathletes for being here today to support a wonderful cause HooliCares

Hooli cares

Do you

Take your marks

Hes in the water

You sure

I cracked into Gavins HooliWatch

Dont ask me how I did it

Ive got realtime GPS location blood pressure body temperature heart rate

I can even see where he is in his menstrual cycle

Looks like a good day to fuck him

So I guess were gonna talk all damn day

 That the play

 Uh no

No

Were calling him okay

So  lets do this

 Okay

Cause it just seemed like Lex Skelton

Hey uh its um Richard Hendricks

Id like to ask for you to call an emergency meeting of the Hooli board of directors

Flank that little fucker in the black cap

Uh weve tried to uh contact Gavin Belson but uh he hasnt responded

We do however have a quorum

Lets proceed

Great

We'll I would like to present you with an offer and uh judging by the current state of Hooli I think youll find it very interesting

All right according to the company charter Gavin Belson does have two hours to formally object

Right

Yeah two hours so Thats no problem at all

Youve seen my offer but unless everyone agrees to sell theres no deal because I need total control of the company

 So whos in

 Richard I expect a lot of us are on the fence here

Lex stop

Gavin

 Huh

 I thought he was in the race

 Gavin

 Yeah he is

Looks like hes waiting about a mile from the finish line

Oh

You are a sneaky little gladiator arent you Richard

But the Hooli charter which I wrote gives me the right to block this transaction

Uh no

It doesnt

Yeah thats right

You uh you had two hours which lapsed Seven minutes ago

Im afraid theyre right

Shit

Okay fine

I cant block it

But come on Lex

We have a history together

You wrote the very first check to Hooli

Youre not gonna turn your back on 30 years of making money together are you

I know were not in the strongest position right now but I will fight my way back thats what I do

II kick and I scrap and II play dirty

Anything to win

III couldve bailed Richard out but I didnt

I fucked him

And then I fucked over world poker tour there

Just for the spite of it just because I could

Look forget all the bullshit about making the world a better place

The most valuable companies in this valley were built and run byby savages who cheat to win

Zuckerberg and Jobs and me Gavin Belson

So please Lex put the pen down

Leave your money where it is

If this is a competition to find out who the shittier person is Im not sure its something that I can add to

I can

 Dinesh

 This must be said

Gavin you think youre the most spiteful guy in town but youre not even the most spiteful guy in this room

The truth is Im a bad person

How do you think we got the money for this deal

I lied to my cousins face

He is going to lose 40 million give or take plus his estate in Hawaii I hope

See

I suck

Did you know that instead of breaking up with a girl that scared me I called the FBI and sent her to prison

 The Teslas

 Right

I pressured my direct reports to buy Teslas that they could not afford because I wanted better wheels than a guy named Danny

And I was eight years old I stole my friend Alis jump rope and tied it to the back of a truck that drove away and then I told him I had no idea what happened to it

And when he cried himself to sleep I ate his British candy and told him God took it because he hated him

 Jesus

 So if this decision is going to come down to who is the most spiteful then respectfully sir  Stop

Stop

 I would argue Just stop talking

I dont wanna be in business with any of you people

I dont even wanna be in the same room with you

Im gonna sign this and take my money out

Oop

Gonna miss my bus

Ugh Excuse me

Excuse me

Excuse me

Think you won

fuck you Richard Hendricks

The Valley is small and the road is long

Just keep looking over your shoulder

Gentlemen

And lady Ow

Hoover

Help

Guys Did we Just buy Hooli

Yeah we did

Holy shit

Feels pretty good

Wajeed is gonna be so pissed at me

And moms gonna kll me

So I guess uh everyone got what they want

We'll actually uh Jared

Hey uh I just wanna say like Im really sorry about everything and uh well of course Id be happy to give you and Gwart your company back

Thats obvious

And also if you needed office space wed be happy to have you

Um I guess I dont know I just I miss you man

Whatever I dont care

Jesus

Yeah its sort of his thing

All right well everybodys gathered out there  so you should probably say something

 Okay

Be gracious and dont expect too much

What are you talking about

I mean wont they be happy

I freed them from Gavin

I mean thats one way of looking at it

Or your company just swallowed theirs and you fired their founder and CEO

Theyre probably a little freaked out

They wanna know that theyre gonna keep their jobs

But we dont know if they will

 Right

 Yeah

We'll youll think of something

Just be yours  Keep it short

Keep it short

 Yeah

Okay Okay

This is a video called Maximizing Alphaness

You just gotta subconsciously absorb it

This is the dumbest thing Ive ever seen

fuck yeah

It turns out my real parents are alive

So you gave me up to simplify your first class air travel

Thats a clear row across

A B C and D

Do we think this photo of Richard is funny

He was acting like your boss

You need to assert dominance

Ah

Its complicated

Youre the only one who got hurt
