CLEARS THROAT

Should I look at the GRUNTS

camera or you

INTERVIEWER You can just talk to me

Can you introduce yourself

Sure

Yeah um Uh my name is Richard Hendricks and Im the My name is Richard Hendricks and  INTERVIEWER Just  My name is Richard Hendricks

Im uh the founder and CEO of Pied Piper

I think like most people I first heard about Pied Piper  at TechCrunch Disrupt

  Middleout was a game changer

 ANNOUNCER The winner of this year is Pied Piper

What you have to understand is conventional compression  was like rubbing two sticks together

 And along comes Pied Piper out of nowhere with a fricking blowtorch

It seemed like they really had their act together

 I thought about acquiring them  uh but I guess I got distracted

INTERVIEWER So when did you first hear about Pied Piper

You mean when did I hear someone had first stolen  my Nucleus project

 We'll we had really just started um a few months earlier

And like a bunch of other Silicon Valley companies we were just working out of a garage

Or a house  INTERVIEWER Nice place

 No

 Those early days of Pied Piper  kinda sucked

SIGHS

We had to clean for ourselves

It was like a shit hole

But there was so much shit in it it was filled all the way up

So it was like level with the ground

If thats true there was a little meniscus in the shit and thats where our dreams lived

One of my favorite things is to just be napping and then to wake up and have people around

And that used to happen all the time when I was homeless but INHALES

this was like that but with shelter

 I think they all abided by the same rule  to like shower every other day

So it smelled a lot

Uh like BO

And um you know they didnt have money so they they didnt have a cleaner

Uh and Lord knows they werent going to clean so there was um you know a good layer of filth just on the ground

Not the kind of house you want to take your shoes off in

Um and uh yeah just fucking smelled

Really bad

 It was all right

 JianYang won the house from me in a game of chance

He told me to pick a number between one and ten

I picked seven um but it was three

Hmm you live you learn now I'll always pick three

The fucking weird thing about that house  I never saw any chicks in that house

 Never any

It was all just a bunch of fucking lame dudes

They should have been bathing in fucking sheju like shejizz shegoo

Like fucking like you know like knuckle lube

INTERVIEWER There was one guy though right

Oh yeah Yeah that guy fucked

It was Camelot It was Narnia

It was Waco and Richard was our dashing featherhaired David Koresh

And we were his wives

But we chose to be there

It was kind of impressive

How how he found different ways to fuck up

He fucked things up over and over and over

Yeah I I met Richard at uh a talk that Peter Gregory was giving and he pitched Peter Gregory a music recognition app that was fucking awful

Uh and it ended up becoming Pied Piper

So what the fuck do I know

ALARM BUZZES

 When people ask me about Pied Piper  I always tell them the same thing Are there other questions

Uh yeah can you elaborate

Yes

Will you

Uh hmm INTERVIEWER So you worked with Laurie Bream

 Mmhmm

 Uh we spoke to Laurie she actually referred to you as her best friend

SMACKS LIPS

Laurie Bream said that I was her best friend

INTERVIEWER Yeah

Oh

STUTTERS

fuck I I dont have to like go visit her now do I

We had knocked around for a few years trying different iterations of what we wanted to do

It was at RussFest when things really got crazy for us

RussFest was the rockhard cock that jizzed Pied Piper  onto the worlds tits

 LAUGHS

DINESH CHUGTAI It was so much money

It was so much money that I actually looked into how much money it would take to fill up a swimming pool so I could swim in money like Scrooge McDuck

Not as much money as youd think

It would have been an all handson deck at Yankee Candle

CHUCKLES

Because I wouldve I wouldve ordered up a storm

There were a couple Soviet submarines I had my eye on

To me it wasnt about the money I just wanted to you know be able to put it in peoples faces

Like I wanted to go home for Thanksgiving and say to my sister like Oh cool youre the fanciest girl in Mommy and Me

We'll fuck you Im a billionaire

And fuck Daren too

Such a fucking asshole that mother fucker

Yeah times were good

They call it PiperNet and its coming to your phone

 Tomorrow at noon the Pied Piper app  will go live on the latest 5Gequipped iOS and Android phones in ten major cities across the country

 AT&T says If things go as planned  PiperNet could be on more than a half billion devices within a year

And no one is more excited than technology super fans

 Like the ones behind me  CHEERS

 who are camping out all night to snag  a limitededition Pied Piperequipped smartphone

If their enthusiasm is anything to go by then a lot more people may soon be lining up to pay the Piper

CHUCKLES

Im Jim Gitman KCTW

 I am Pied Piper

 I am Pied Piper

 I am Pied Piper

 I am Pied Piper

I am Pied Piper

We are Pied Piper

INTERVIEWER Day of the launch halfanhour to go

What uh what was going through your head

Yeah I mean all All indications pointed to a successful launch

Sorry do you have Do we have water

JARED DUNN I mean he was the most relaxed Id ever seen him

He had the the cool confident swagger of a young Montgomery Clift with none of the private sexual misery

We'll maybe a little

Oh yeah I I was sure it was gonna work right from the beginning

It pretty sure

Most of the time

We were all pretty nervous

Especially Dinesh

He shat his pants

I chose to not be there because to me I never did this for the fame or the adulation you know

To me its always been about the work

God to be around me during that time

I must have been so annoying

I was just walking around chest bumping any bro I could get my chest against

INTERVIEWER So uh what do you remember about the launch

CLICKS TONGUE

Um there were some dogs that did some tricks and a sports guy

Would you say that Pied Piper is your MVP

Most valuable phone

Yeah I would

 CHEERING

 He was tall um Cant remember what sport he played

But nice guy

Uh yeah I was just trying to do everything I could not to screw it up

GULPS

REPORTER In a fairy tale turned nightmare come to life thousands of rats streamed onto the streets of San Francisco today

Pied Pipers phones broadcasting intense ultrasonic sounds

REPORTER 2 News spin we have a rat problem

The streets of Seattle became the streets of Searattle

 And everyone was sleepless

 Giants fans going home happy today as the Cubs go down swinging to the Holy shit

Theyre calling it Ratmageddon

Yeah

Except in New York where theyre calling it  Wednesday

 LAUGHTER APPLAUSE

CHEERING

They literally became the Pied Piper I mean you cant make that up

What you have to understand is rats

I thought I might have to start a a new division in my foundation to deal with the wave of ratborn disease

When you think about a lot of the failures in tech Pets

com Theranos WeWork Pied Piper really is right at the top of that list

Pied Piper is just a millstone around AT&Ts neck

I say dump it dump it now

I lost so much fucking money with those guys

I got rat fucked

Thats a pun

I made it all back though sweet investment in the hair transplant sector

What

Rats uh yes we have some of them here

Figuratively

They are dealt with

Heres the thing about rats

Nobody likes them

Literally no one likes rats

I actually prefer rats to humans if I had the choice

I had a pet rat when I was a little kid

I saw all the fucking rats I was like Ratup bitches

All these fucking chicks screaming I got laid that night

Rats are wonderful creatures

We used them in many experiments in the early days of Hooli

Turns out they can withstand massive amounts of radiation with minimal damage

I mean they live in a lab

What do they need whiskers and tails for anyway

They were out for cheese and wires

They chewed through copper

They chewed through one womans hand

She shouldve moved though I think I dont want to victim blame

Do you know how they ended up getting rid of the rats

INTERVIEWER I think they just ran away

Where

And so effective immediately I am shutting down Pied Piper deleting its code repositories and liquidating its remaining assets

All right thats our statement

We will not be taking any further ques And can I just say that I am just truly deeply sorry

Uh this should never have been built

It is technically flawed to its very core

And we should all remember that forevermore

Sorry

REPORTERS CHAT&TERING

Obviously Mr

Hendricks doesnt mean that in any legally binding or actionable way

 Get a life guys

 CHAT&TERING CONTINUES

Its weird

It really seemed like Pied Piper was going to work

Something doesnt add up

Heartbreaking doesnt even begin to describe how all of us felt about the failure of Pied Piper

Oh my God oh my God

GASPS

Oh my God

All of us shocked

Failure is terrible

Unlike Dinesh Im not accustomed to it

But I do want to clarify that I wasnt there at the launch so the failure of Pied Piper wasnt really my fault

INTERVIEWER What uh kind of advice would you give to somebody experiencing a massive public failure

CHUCKLES

We'll I Ive never failed

So I have many advice for winners

Um you know my my career has been a trajectory of succeeding upwards until I tired of being at the top

We'll I was pretty embarrassed so I uh I laid low for a little bit

Uh I traveled

Richard and I went on a world tour to eat pray love

Actually I met uh Jared in in Zurich

We went to Zurich we went to Amsterdam we went to Copenhagen

I saw him again in uh Madrid

Richard and I went to a flamenco show

I begged him to try it because I just felt that it would unlock his body

But um He said he wanted to stay locked

Did not expect to see him in Thailand but uh then since he was there we did uh our little Southeast Asia tour

I felt like we were Tegan and Sara on the road together

And lo and behold he was on the return flight

It was the trip of a lifetime

I went to Tibet actually to try and find Erlich

But uh he was gone

And then I came back but no one really wanted to hire the guy behind Pied Piper

Uh however my best friend did hire me

And now I am the Gavin Belson Professor of uh Ethics in Technology at Stanford University

This is all the great people I work with

Stanford hat

This was when Russ Hanneman really thought we should have schwag schwag

The schwag

A mug

PAPER RUSTLING

This is the patent Pied Piper had middleout

May I be honest

There was a period of my life in which I would have rooted for the failure of Richard Hendricks
