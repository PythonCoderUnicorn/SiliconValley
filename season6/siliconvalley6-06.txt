I am about to sit down with AT&T trying to close this massive deal but that all depends on getting Hawaii right

And you would rather do Hawaii than RussFest

I would rather do my own mother than RussFest

Ive made myself the CEO of YaoNet which Im moving back to the US

Son of Anton its the name Ive given our new inference API

He can do whatever he wants

I call for the attorney general of the state of California to launch an immediate investigation of my conduct as CEO of Hooli

Enjoy the injunction thumb ass

Don Delarenta the AG of California is gonna do  what I tell him to do

 Why

Cause I have dirt on him

You ready to dump Hawaii and join RussFest

DINESH CHUGTAI Its beautiful

Boom

RICHARD And upon entering RussFest each attendee will be given a PiperNet enabled smartphone which will give them access to secure messaging social voice Internet So boring right

You see the new logo

Huh

Huh

Check

One two three

Tres Comas Tequila

Russ

So is Puddle of Mudd

You know Puddle of Mudd

SINGING ALONG Everything is so blurry And everyones so fake And everyone is empty And everything is so messed up Right

Yeah you know Puddle of Mudd

Awesome

This is a good meeting guys excellent

I gotta jet

Bye guys

Cory where you at dawg

Were really excited about the possibility of working with you

MICHAEL Cool

CHUCKLES

Yeah

So uh what do you uh What do you think Michael

Uh you and us

AT&T Pied Piper

Dealy deal

Richard your tech is impressive but were going with YaoNet theyre a safe bet

And by the way it doesnt seem like youre telling your people out there whats really happening

 Hang on  No

Maybe you can do a deal with someone else

You know theres uh  No no we cant Michael

 Look we already have an agreement in principle

Okay well if you have an agreement in principle you can have a disagreement in principle

Im sorry

Im very sorry

Michael Im sorry that youre missing out on this opportunity

Honestly I walk everyone to their car

Yeah

What can we do to sweeten the pot

You know

Oh we could add cashless transactions

What if everything is handled on the phone

Right

You use it to swipe into parties  or VIP areas  Richard this is done

 Okay

 What about holograms

Okay this is your last chance

Are you in or out

TIRES SCREECH

 RICHARD fuck

 That appears to imply out

fuck

fuck it

fucker

 Cockfucker

 Richard people in there have been working themselves half to death for weeks for no pay

This is not going to go over well

Im gonna wait out here while you go in and tell them

Im not gonna say anything

If I keep my mouth shut then theres still a chance at snaking the YaoNet deal

But if I tell everyone in there whats really going on we wont make it to RussFest and well be dead

 Is that what you want

 Thats a fair point

Thats what I thought

Okay

CLAPS

Lets get back to work

Lets go

If this comes out I'll cover your ass if you cover mine

If what comes out

 My man

 No

THEME SONG PLAYING

SIGHS

Oh

CHUCKLING

Dodgy gadin my merry knights of Piper

Sir Owen doing valiant battle with the authentication service

Yes good

Yeah

Oh and prithee Becky my queen how goeth cashless payments

Russs pricing keeps tripping us up

 Okay how so

 We'll this morning he decided everyone at RussFest should be a billionaire so every dollar someone puts into their account will now be worth one billion RussBucks

Zwoons

So what like a sandwich will be worth 15 billion RussBucks or something

Fourteen billion nine hundred and ninetynine million nine hundred and ninetynine thousand nine hundred and ninetynine RussBucks and ninetynine RussCents because he thought that would sound cheaper

Its kind of screwing up the interface but the whole AT&T deal is riding on this right

We'll get there

Good

Okay

Excellent

We'll uh code like the wind my lady

CHUCKLES

Yeah

Ho ho

Good Friar Gabriel

How dost thou fair with the ticketing module

GRUNTS

Its gone

What do you mean gone

For some reason Gilfoyle deleted the whole thing  a few minutes ago

 What

Yeah

 Gilfoyle

 Yes Richard

Im aware

The drone dispatching code has been deleted and Im working very hard to restore the right version

Whoa whoa

Drone code

Gabe just told me that the ticketing module got deleted

Ticketing too

fuck thats problematic

I'll get on that next

What the fuck is going on

Based on the amount of work left to do and the number of hours left before the festival I decided to task Son of Anton to use machine learning to debug some of our code

What

Gilfoyle are you fucking kidding me

You gave your AI permission to overwrite code in the internal file system

 Were you gonna tell me about this

 No

I thought that was the company policy  these days

 Okay well your AI just failed epically

Thats unclear

Its possible that Son of Anton decided that the most efficient way to get rid of all the bugs was to get rid of all the software which is technically and statistically correct

But artificial neural nets are sort of a black box  so well never know for sure

 DINESH Hey Richard

Did you order meat

Like a bunch of meat

Like 4000 pounds of meat

Interesting

I put Son of Anton on finding us cheap hamburgers for lunch

It looks like the reward function was a little underspecified

Okay from now on Son of Anton is banned

Just write code like a normal human fucking being please

DINESH Hey Gilfoyle

So Ive been thinking about your AI and its many deficits

I think Son of Antons issue might be how its handling reward uncertainty

Your issue may be insecurity masked by false bravado and unisex cologne

fuck off

Its not unisex

SNIFFS

Hey um Richard

I was curious if you had a moment to clear the air

Is this about Holden

No

Holdens a bitch and he quit

No II wanted to talk to you about the Gwartshaped tension between us

You know she and I worked very closely together and now shes working for YaoNet

Shes essentially the enemy so it would be fair for you to have concerns

I have no concerns

Okay good

Because I dont think about her you know or if shes hungry or cold right now or if shes still giving most of her income to Rand Paul

Richard

Check it

Okay

Hologram question

You told AT&T that the hologram would be interactive right

 Yes

 See asshole

My hologram can 100 dry hump festivalgoers from behind

If they ask for it

Hashtag woke

All right

Lets go

Spidey jump

Ticketings running smoothly

Mobile purchasing seems stable

Thats good

 Russ

Hey

 I fucked up Richard

Why did I make one dollar worth a billion RussBucks

I mean everyone wants to be a billionaire but they didnt earn it so are they gonna feel bad about themselves

Why would I do that

I guess because Im an asshole and I wanna have a bad festival

RICHARD No no Russ

Dont worry about it

Everything is amazing

 Yeah

 Yeah I tell you what

Why dont we see the hologram

 The holograms ready

 Its up

 Yeah lets go see the hologram

 Okay come on

 This way

CHUCKLING

 fuck yeah

fucking hologram

NOISY CHAT&TERING

HOLOGRAM HUMMING

 RICHARD See

There he is

 RUSS Okay

Yeah thats pretty sweet

Fist bump

Dry hump

 Double gns

 CRACKLING

Wait whats it doing

Richard what the fuck

We'll uh uh Once more people show up the network effect will take over and it will stabilize I promise

Do you swear

Because one time I threw a party and David Copperfield said it was beat

Promise me that this will not be beat

It wont be beat

 Okay

Okay

 Yeah

I know I know

Why did I wear these pants

Part denim part leather

Pick a lane Russ

fuck

fuck

fuck Im gonna change my pants

BEEPS

RICHARD Jared what are you doing

Come on

Hey what the fuck is going on

Russs hologram is glitching like crazy

DINESH We dont know

Everythings lagging our apps third party apps transactions

GILFOYLE Everything was fine and then the network started deteriorating

We should be way closer to 100 capacity by now

Im running diagnostics but I havent found anything

Also this trailer is filled with ants

fucking Gabe

Im sorry maam I dont know anything about a Pied Piper girls coding camp

Oh ask Priyanka

That sounds like her bag of bullshit

I did its not hers

Im sorry

You said you spoke to an employee named Eric Bachman

Mmhmm

Mmhmm

WHISPERING Hey

Give me that

Hi

Does your Eric Bachman have a Chinese accent

Okay

I tweaked the microwave backhaul antennas

Did that make any difference to the Is there something you wanna tell us

I respect you all

BEEPS

MAXIMO Hello

I am giving a press conference and I am so happy to be in partnership with AhTayeeTay

You can surf our decentralized Internet like Hawaiian surfers can surf the big waves

BEEPS

Whoa

Bombshell

Michael mustve known they were going with YaoNet

Did you know

You knew and you added more features

Ticketing banking the fucking hologram

Youve had us on a death march for nothing

What

Richard

No

 Aah

 CLAT&TERS

SIGHS

Gilfoyle youre being awfully quiet

 Did you know

 RICHARD Now look guys these deals never really ever close

DANNY AT&T and YaoNet close deal

 That seems pretty closed to me

My guys

How dare you do this to my guys

Can we just please have this discussion later because right now we need to figure out We

Whos we

 Were out

 Yeah

What

Whoa

Whoa whoa whoa

My guys

 CHAIR RAT&TLING

 Gabe You can go

I'll contact you all later for your exit interviews and Im sorry about the ants

We'll at least we all stuck together

RICHARD Okay

Look all the systems are built

I mean screw those guys for leaving

Their loss

We can still do this without them right

No

Unless the three of us stay up 24 hours a day for three days in a row

fuck

Yeah exactly

Okay

All we need to do is just find the bug thats stalling us and squash it just like these fucking ants

No sleep for three days straight

Sweet

 DINESH Is that Gwart

 Oh no

Its a garbage can

DINESH No thats Gwart

We'll she works for YaoNet so what is she doing here

And why does she have access to the staff only area

Gwart hates Puddle of Mudd

Shes a Linkin Park girl

You gotta be fucking kidding me

Big Head

What the hell is going on here

 What do you mean

 JIANYANG Who let her in

I take one lousy shit JianYang what is going on here

All girls coding camp

I support woman

Mr

Eric Im finished

This diet cream helped my husband lose weight

He was fat fuck

Now he not

Fi star the end

 I wrote exactly like Mr

Eric told me to

Its very good Sophie

Very good

Youre using underage girls as slave labor for a fake Amazon review farm

Yes

AndAnd youre using the Pied Piper name

Yes

Its okay

I have money

SCOFFS

Girls

Call your parents

 JARED God that really is her

 RICHARD What the fuck

Its sabotage

Guys nobodys eating the peyote

Will you eat the peyote and then thatll break the ice and theyll eat the peyote

What

You hate the shorts

You hate the shorts

fuck it

Just look at my fucking legs

Lets go

Go

RICHARD I knew it

I knew it

Our networks not slowing down because we fucked up

Its because YaoNets here and they are attacking us

Is SlipSox even a real company

Incorporated a week ago no website

Its a cover

Its YaoNet

Laurie is somehow fucking with our routing to slow down the network

But why would they bother attacking us

They have the AT&T deal all locked up

Unless they dont

If she thinks their Hawaii launch might fail that would be a reason to try to wipe us out while they have the chance

So if we can stay alive till YaoNet fucks up Hawaii we could swoop in

Like a basketball dunker

 Were still in this boys

 JARED All right

So lets boot those meddling bums off of the network

Enough of this crap

Yeah

We'll uh thats impossible cause the whole point of a decentralized network is to prevent a single host from controlling access

So dictators cant ban dissidents

Right now theres no way to kll them or stop them throttling the network

This is why things are easier in China

China Dont mess with Pied Piper again you little fucker

 PHONE VIBRATING

 SIGHS

SIGHS

Hello

JianYang

Hey

Hey uh whats going on boss man

CHUCKLES

Hows it going dude

Very bad

My underage girl slaves all left

Oh yeah totally

Bummer

We'll youll find them

Anyway kind of a silly question um You know how you stole the Pied Piper source code

 Yes

 Yeah and then you rewrote it into what is now YaoNet

 Yes

 Right um did the Chinese government by any chance require you to add a back door

Yes I have a SSH key in my house  written down

 Cool

Wow

Uh CHUCKLES

I dont suppose I could get that from you

Uh its just that Pied Pipers in kind of a jam

Yes

Pied Piper Your white witch just shut down my business

 BEEPS

 Oh

Thank you

Uh thanks guys

Thanks Big Head

All right YaoNet SlipSox whoever the fuck you are you think you can fuck with us

They hung up

 Oh

 Yeah

 Wait what the fuck is this

 DINESH This is YaoNets server

fuck

Its a honeypot

What is that a good thing

No

Its not

Run the file command

Its basically a bullshit shell in case the Chinese government actually used the key

Its like a fake storefront

Okay so they have to be running SSH on a different port

How do we find the real one

We could Nmap it to check every single one but that would take forever

Okay

fuck

We'll somehow we have to find the correct port number

Wait what time is it

One large artichoke extra rare cup of mayonnaise

I see you still take your snack at 317

I know that SlipSox is YaoNet and that youve infiltrated Pied Piper and I know that youre here working with Laurie Bream

No let me finish

We didnt end on the best of terms but when we were together I feel like I really saw you the real you

I saw you Gwart

I know you

No let me finish

I have to say this or Im never gonna get it out

Now I wish I was asking you to go for a walk with me or to watch Magic Mike XL for the umpteenth time but Im asking you to give us access to YaoNet and not just to save my company but to save my sanity

Because if I was wrong about who you are then I dont know who I am

So there you have it

Ive said all I gotta say and its up to you now

I see

So Pied Pipers network capacity is degrading steadily

Hmm wonderful

And their adaptive routing optimization techniques arent helping them

Hey guys

Um Im so sorry I dont know what you did but it worked




    push

 JARED What

 Someone just messaged us the correct port  to YaoNets ad server

 Yeah

 RICHARD CHUCKLING

 Really

Yep

Gilfoyle revoked all their access and is removing their app from every client on PiperNet

RICHARD In a couple of minutes well be back up to speed

Plus we cloned their repository so well just poke around and see exactly what theyre hiding

Its a big win for the Piper boys

CHUCKLES

So Gilfoyle how much faster is our network now

Zero faster

Its slower  and still degrading

 What are you talking about

About how our network is slower and still degrading

Were currently at 60

But thats not possible

Our networks shit latency  is slowing down every single purchase

 ANGRY CHAT&TERING

Look at the bathrooms

The scanners arent working

RICHARD fucking Russ and his pay toilets

Okay we gotta figure this out or theres gonna be a riot

There you assholes are

You guys fucking with me

Did you get my messages

Uh Messagings stalling too

I sent you guys photos of three different outfits

Did you hate them all

Wha Whats wrong

Uh no

Definitely the second one

 I like the second one

 You really think a white guy can wear that and get away with it

 GILFOYLE Definitely

 DINESH No

You know what

Youre right

fuck political correctness

Im looking at four guys that fuck

Okay lets rerun the diagnostics

Maybe we missed something

LAURIE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY

Laurie

RICHARD Laurie Bream

We'll well well

 Fleeing the scene of the crime

 Crime

You cant win

Your network is garbage

And maybe if you save us some time by telling us how youre slowing down our network I wont go to the police

Slowing down your network

That would be untethical

  Why would I  SCOFFS

Oh

Richard You do not know

Know what

As you correctly surmised YaoNet doesnt work

It does not scale

 Ha

 However we did not come here to attack you simply to observe you spy on you if you wish in order to see how you got PiperNet to work which it turns out you did not

Uh what

SCOFFS

Your compression is inadequate in the face of bottlenecks that emerge between nodecluster edges

Pied Piper does not scale

It is as impracticable as YaoNet

fuck

LAURIE Ah yes

That cant be right

LAURIE And yet it is

I wish we had plagiarized more functional code and yet it is this technology that AT&T has purchased functional or no

And with Maximos sufficient funding we will certainly be able to weather the storm until we reach launch at which time it seems likely that AT&T may deem our business a failure

However at this point I will have already made many multiples on my initial investment

Ah I cannot speak to your backup plan

Hmm yes

Good day gentlemen

We'll shes just a hater and no disrespect  but she can eat shit

 DINESH Yeah obviously

We have to be able to figure something out

Youll think of something right

Richard

Six fucking years

Six years weve wasted

Building this worthless piece of shit

Are fucking kidding me

PANTING

Im fine

I just gotta go to the bathroom

I dont think he thought of anything

CROWD CHAT&TERING

 Yeah

LAUGHS

 MUSIC PLAYING

Go with option one and Im not gonna feel shitty about it

Right

fuck me

DINESH Hey guys Richards been locked in there for three hours

Should we kick down the door

No lets honor him with some space

I'll wait for him to fall asleep and then I'll I'll lower myself down through the vent

 BURPS

 DINESH Would it be a dick move to ask him for his keys and then we drive home

We'll hed be abandoned here Holy shit

Thats fantastic

 What the fuck

 DRONES BUZZING

Hey you guys

I did something

All right so I was uh fiddling around on Gilfoyles laptop and I was looking down and then I realized that the solution was staring at me right in the face

Ants

It occurred to me that our network is kind of like a series of paths much like the trails ants use in order to forage for food

But then I thought that we dont need better paths

We need better ants

You see

 fuck gradient descent

 What

I dont need to use Gilfoyles AI in order to improve middleout

I need to use middleout to create a new AI

A symbolic AI

And now it is teaching itself how to optimize

So you fucked around with Son of Antons brain and then gave him access to our entire network infrastructure  while its still running

 Yes

Richard thats like asking a robot to change your tire while youre driving on the freeway

Hold this

Gimme

See go

This isnt my computer

 Its not

 GILFOYLE No

And what the fuck is Son of Anton version 2

0

What

 Huh

 You were fucking around with Son of Antons brain before him

 fuck

 I have good ideas

 EXPLOSIONS

 CROWD SCREAMING

Sweet mother of God

DINESH This is not my fault

I barely touched Gilfoyles AI

 EXPLOSIONS

 RICHARD Whats it doing

GILFOYLE I have no idea

I told you its a fucking black box Richard

RICHARD Do you think theres gonna be a riot

DINESH Oh Im sure 20000 cokedup douchebags will be very civil when they cant get food or water

GILFOYLE Holy shit look at the hologram

RICHARD Oh my God

Whoa

PANICKED CHAT&TERING

BUZZING CRACKLING

You guys are smart

VOCALIZING Voice command

What just happened

Did it work

What What just happened

GILFOYLE Holy shit

JARED Wait is that right

Its at 145

Now 160

Okay how is this possible

Our network overhead mustve massively shrunk

Its insane

Oh my God

Okay My middleout Gilfoyles AI whatever the fuck Dinesh did to Gilfoyles AI I basically rewrote the entire thing

You guys it worked

ItItIt happened

 Wewewe did it

Wewewe won

 DINESH It worked
