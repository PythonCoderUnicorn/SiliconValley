 Why would we do it for free

 Because its cool

 RICHARD We'll Russ we appreciate the interest I like where this is going

 But  fuck

Uh right now we are trying to launch a huge pilot program in Hawaii

Dinesh is actually heading out there first thing tomorrow morning and I am about to sit down with the network operations president of ATT trying to close this massive deal but that all depends on getting Hawaii right

Theres just no way we could do both

And you would rather do Hawaii than RussFest

I would rather do my own mother than RussFest

How come whenever you guys wanna do some shit Im always like fuck yeah But whenever I wanna do some cool shit you guys piss all over it

HOST caution and accountability

Thanks for being here

GAVIN We'll I always find time for you Gabby

Please

No one is buying your bullshit Gavin

GAVIN My message invigorates me

For too long these large tech companies have harvested our data they have violated our privacy they have tracked our every move

They is you you hypocrite

You did that

He did that

Starting today I will be asking prominent members of the tech community to sign their name onto this

A code of conduct authored by me that pledges them to a universal ethos which I created that I call tech ethics or tethics for short

 Oof

 GABBY Tethics

Clever

 GIGGLING

 No

No it isnt

fuck that guy

Honestly fuck that guy

Richard I have your tea

No one in town is ever gonna sign this hypocrites  hypocritical garbage

 GABBY We'll Im sold

Can I sign

GAVIN We'll you have to lead a corporation

Okay

And how about you at home

Are you tethical

Tweet us GoodDayTheBay and let us know where you stand

Sure yes I will

Get ready for some opinions

Holden

Why is the television on the news

Jared I dont need you telling me my job okay

Holden um I know things have been a bit antagonistic between us

Weve been like uh Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan

But Ive been thinking about it and you work for Richard and I want whats best for him cause I want him to be happy so from now on youre my friend

Youre my best friend

Even if you make the occasional oopsie

Are you fucking with me

Why would I do that to my best friend

 Love you like a brother

 Uh Absolutely not

We havent told you what we want yet

 Irrelevant

 Sit down

 Thank you

 TRACY Id like to talk to you about your PiperPulse numbers

GILFOYLE Id like that Tracy because I have no idea what the fuck that is

Of course you do

Its the system that Tracy created for employees to give feedback on senior management

TRACY The point is I happen to know a lot of folks over at ATT and I think it might help us if I backchannel some of the information Ive gathered

But before I do Id like to tell you how youre doing

I know how Im doing

Im fucking killing it

Im building great shit out there

Yes

Your acumen scores are excellent

On a scale of one to 10 youre at a 9 9

So all 10s and  Dinesh

 But its your interpersonal rating Id like to drill down on

Its at 1 5

Your coworkers find you unapproachable rude and capable of great hurt with an unsettling stare

Okay

We want ATT to see a thriving company

If you really make a concerted effort at outreach and team building  you could get your numbers up

 GILFOYLE Tracy

I appreciate you wanting to participate in the world of numbers

I find it endearing

But yours are horseshit

They measure nothing

If I wanted to I could have all 10s by the end of the week

Gilfoyle metrics like PiperPulse are a widely accepted measure of how your peers feel about you

Speaking of Monica your interpersonal is at a 2

 What

 Huh

No thats just because Priyanka and her little witchs nest over at Foxhole are bringing my numbers down

No

Most of your lower scores are coming from engineers who are 84 male

Maybe you should try some of that outreach

Whatever I do Im sure I could do it better than you

Two days

All 10s

Deal

 INDISTINCT CHATTER

 Aloha

Aloha to you

Aloha

Alo  Oh hey Dinesh

 What the fuck

I like your beard

Um why are you here

Wheres AJ

Oh AJ cant come

You wanted him to become a certified scuba before the trip right

Yeah so we could fucking scuba Gabe

We'll he finished all his check dives last night but you have to wait 24 hours before you fly so we decided to trade places

 For the day

 Uh no

Fforfor all of it

 Why

 Because it  ititd be easier

 No

And what are you doing in first class

So the pilot is from Pakistan

I said Hey I know a guy from Pakistan

I work with him

 And then he said Hey why dont you come to the front and sit in the big chairs

 Bbut thats me

Im the guy from Pakistan

I told him that and then he and then he put me here

Okay but I the guy from Pakistan  Right

 am back in economy

Sir

Youre gonna need to take your seat

And Captain Bashir wanted you to have these samosas his mother made

Oh

No thank you

TYPING

You gotta be fucking kidding me

Hey Danny

Excuse me

 What are you wearing

 A shirt

SCOFFS

 Oh my God

 I think a lot of what Gavin is saying makes sense

Yeah of course it does

Ive been saying it for years

 So you agree with him

 We'll no

He is full of shit

But you arent even though youre saying the same things

Yeah because I mean it

And I said it first

That feels petty and personal which is against Gavins code of tethics

 What does that even mean

 Hey Richard  are you signing Gavins pledge

 Ah what

Because Im getting a lot of heat from my friends over at Facebook for working at an untethical company

Okay cool

So Facebook is calling us untethical

Yeah because they signed the pledge

So did Google and Amazon and Twitter

 Dont care

 DANNY Speaking of even if you dont sign could you at least stop tweeting about it

Anyone who signs this Tethics thing is a thumbass

 That doesnt even make sense

 CHUCKLE

Yes it does

Its dumbass but with thumb

Thumbass

Its basically perfect

Tethics is tech ethics

Whats the thumb part

And why are you tweeting that from your personal account

The Verge referred to you as notable tethics holdout and amateur insult comedian Richard Hendricks

  SIGH

 Andy Borowitz wrote a pointed piece about you  called Doubting Richard

  Ah see

That doesnt really make any sense

I mean whats the pun

What am I supposed to be enjoying there

Now youre harshing on Borowitz

We'll yeah if hes coming up with those zingers

If you like Andy Borowitz so much why dont you marry him

Says the guy whos three months behind in child support

A dog is not a child

 Uh  Michael Eisenberg from ATT is on the phone

 He says its urgent

 Ah great

Hey Michael whats up

Did you just publicly insult my boss

What

No

Anyone who signs this Tethics thing is a thumbass

 We'll my boss just signed Gavin Belsons pledge

 He did

Why

 MICHAEL Because loudmouths like you got up in front of Congress and whined about how somebody needed to do something about big tech

Okay I did that one time MICHAEL And now Gavin has managed to paint himself as that guy

And we all have to fall in line or well be in PR hell

Or worse

We'll face government regulation

MICHAEL Look have you read his pledge

LAUGHS

No of course not

Its trash

The first line says We the undersigned promise to make best efforts to blah blah blah

Best efforts Richard

Its totally toothless

Yes

Exactly Michael

Thats entirely my point

Its all empty bullshit

It means nothing

MICHAEL Then who the fuck cares Richard

Do not fuck this all up over a pointless moral stand

 Okay

 MICHAEL Sign the fucking pledge

Oh and stop tweeting about thumbs up peoples asses

 Oh

No ththats wordplay

 HANGS UP DIAL TONE

Michael

That is one lucky mug Holden my friend

 Please stop

 Stop what

Youre just trying to creep me out  so that I'll quit

 LAUGHS

What

I mean why wouldnt somebody be nice to you

Are you a piece of shit

CHUCKLES

 GABE Oh hey Dinesh

 DINESH Okay listen Gabe

I spent the entire flight streamlining our setup procedure so I am gonna take the rental convertible and drive tower to tower most of which are on pristine beaches or scenic volcanoes to check coverage while you sit at the office by yourself

 Welcome  Oh

No

No

I get it

Put it on me

II dont want the plastic one

 Are you one of the first cla  Put it on me

Put it on me

Put it on me

Put it Aloha

Richard

To what do I owe the pleasure

Just calling to you know

To what Richard

 Sign your thing

 GAVIN My thing

To sign my thing

I sense a certain lack of commitment Richard

I mean if I suspected the only reason you wanted to lend your name to my cause was because of the enormous pressure youre probably facing as a notable holdout well how could I allow you to add your name to my tethics pledge

That would be untethical

Gavin come on

Just can we get this over with

GAVIN Then again the idea of you publicly committing to the cause that gives me joy

So yes Richard Id be happy to be your moral mentor

I guess I'll see you at the ceremony

 What ceremony

 GAVIN The groundbreaking  for the Institute

 RICHARD What fucking institute

The Belson Institute of Tethics

Its all on our website

You and the others will all be there to publicly commit to the pledge

Also Im gonna be asking you to say a few words

Just a bit about how much of a fan you are dedicated to the cause my cause maybe lead with a joke

Be good to have you there Richard

Securing my legacy with you at my wing

Wear pants you can kneel in

Hey Nathan

I was uh perusing your file and I just Hey

 What

 Sorry

I just um I was quickly perusing your file Thats not what peruse means

Peruse means to read thoroughly and carefully

Wow

That thats super helpful

Thank you for that tip

Um anyway yeah I was just curious to know like whats it like growing up in Rhode Island

We'll maybe some time when youre working on something I can come interrupt your flow and use words incorrectly to tell you about it

Got it

Oh you own a Prius

Popular choice

Later Daniel

What

We'll you win

That is the worst case of contact dermatitis I have ever seen

 The itching is so insane

 Right

 Its like from the inside

 Warren

Come here I want you to see something

This is Warren our resident

This is his first week

Warren I want you to notice the violent allergic reaction to the plumeria flowers used in the patients lei which is weird

Normally they just hand out plastic ones

Just make it stop

We'll the good news is a strong antihistamine shot oughta take care of it in no time

Oh

Great

Yeah

The shot

Justjust gimme the shot

Now before we proceed I should warn you the shot it works like gangbusters but it does tend to cause acute sensitivity to sunlight so youre gonna wanna stay indoors  for four to six weeks

 What

Warren no

We wait until after Ive explained all the possible complications and only then do we administer the injection

 Did you say four to six weeks

 Yep

Otherwise youre gonna be back here for something a lot worse

All right well that was a teachable moment huh

 Yeah

Sure

 Yeah

VIDEO GAME NOISES

I got next

And uh better watch out cause I am the queen of Asteroids

 Are you trying to cut in line

 You dont need a quarter

Its on free play duh

We get it

You make more money than us

Okay you know what

 CARL Gilfoyle youre awesome

 Carl

Youre doin it

What the fuck

My man

Integrity

We do the right thing

We are committed to the highest ethical standards

 Its all such banal selfrighteous hacky bullshit

 And I have to endorse it

 Yeah

It is particularly pedestrian pablum even for Gavin

Responsibility

We contribute to the growth joy and enrichment of all the lives we touch

 Courage   Wait uh  what was that last one

 Responsibility

Uh We contribute to the growth joy and enrichment of all the lives we touch

 Holden

Can you bring the menu book in here please

Hi guy

I am

Holden

Holden

Holden

Holden Ah good

Applebees

We were ordering from here the other night and we were all joking about this uh Yes look

Uh so their mission statement is right near their nachos and we were saying that this is notcho mission statement

 CHUCKLING

 Wait Im sorry

Was that a joke

That

Its its a pun

 Right

 Its just like thumbass you know

Its in the same genre

 JARED Like what

 Thumbass

Ive been saying it a lot

CHUCKLES

Read it read it

At Applebees our mission is to contribute to the growth joy and enrichment of all the lives we touch

 Wait Thats word for word whats in Gavins pledge

Yes it is

 You dont think  Thats exactly what I think

Read me another one of Gavins frilly sentences

Maintaining our uncompromising principles while we grow

 TYPING

SCOFFS

Thats Starbucks

Okay again

Enhance the quality of life for all ages

  Thats the AARP

 Yes

My best friend Gloria was a charter member for 35 years  before she passed

 RICHARD The question is if Gavin stole his entire code of conduct for this stupid fucking foundation what else has he been stealing

MONICA All right I give up

Even this stupid hair didnt work

How are you getting these people to like you

Im not getting anyone to like me

Bullshit

Ive seen you out there

Its like you have a nonevil twin

Its very weird

Monica gaining someones confidence is easy

Appear open and interested by mimicking their body language and repeating what they say back to them

So you just repeat what they say

I just repeat what they say

I was social engineering them

Once trust is established the social engineer simply offers up information and the subject will reciprocate Pets names kids names birthdays

Then that information is entered into a word list generator

Pop it with their hash into John The Ripper and within minutes you have their passwords

So youre just gonna change all your scores to 10s

Yep

Can you do mine too

I dont actually want them to like me

I hate them

I really fucking hate them

I just dont like having 2s

You know I could raise both of our scores and continue this charade

Or I could lower someone elses and put an end to these shenanigans once and for all

I like it

CLINK




    push

APPLAUSE

Thank you

Its quite an event eh

See down there

Its Facebook Google even fucking Bezos sent someone

All here to support the cause

My cause

INDISTINCT SPEAKER

You know who else showed up

Mm

Starbucks

Very good company

Filled with smart people with bold ideas

 I suppose

 Also Anusol Plus

Do you have hemorrhoids Gavin

Not currently

Made by Johnson  Johnson also a good company

Do you know what they do

They spark solutions that create a better healthier world

Just like you

You remember writing that

Im a busy man Richard

Ive lived an incredible life

I saw a yeti one time and forgot for a couple years

We'll I ran your little pledge through a plagiarism detection API

What are you implying Richard

We'll I also looked at transcripts of your interviews and speeches

Your commencement speech at Liberty University

Stolen from an obscure Afghan philosopher

And also do you see that guy right there

That is Rod Morgenstern the author of The Nautilus of Dreams the eBook you blatantly plagiarized and turned into Cold Ice Cream and Hot Kisses

 Do you know how much harder my life has been  because I cared about ethics

 Tethics

I couldve lost my company a dozen different times because I couldnt compromise on my ethics  and now youre turning ethics  Tethics

 Tethics

 into some kind of fucking vanity project

 Tethics Richard

Tethics

 Stop it

Something I came up with on my own

We'll it sounds fuckin dumb

What do you want

Ever since I turned down your 10 million all I ever wanted was for you to just go away

But you and Hooli have tried to fuck me over a thousand different ways

Youre a billionaire

You can do anything you want

You can run for president or buy a fuckin basketball team but you cant do this

And Im gonna make sure of it

So if youll excuse me I have to look over my speech

SPEAKER CONTINUES

Hey

So you guys raised some issues with PiperPulse so I really started looking into it and it turns out there are some real problems with its reliability as a metric

So Im shutting it down

 Aw

 Hm

But the scores are derived from our coworkers the most reliable indicator of job performance

Yeah maybe we could help

You know Im sure if we took a look  under the hood  No

Bad system

Didnt work

Thank you

CLINK

SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGE

SCATTERED APPLAUSE

Oh I guess Im up

 CLAPPING

 Thank you

Thank you Elder Red Spirit for those profound sentiments

Im sorry

I uh I cant do this

SIGH

As humbling as it is to have all of you sitting here paying tribute to me I have to be honest

I have been anything but ethical

In truth I am a plagiarist and a liar and a thief

Ironically the very code of virtue Ive asked you all to abide by was in itself stolen

And perhaps some day someone may erect a foundation the likes of this

But it will not be and should not be me

And in the interest of being truly honest this is not new behavior

I have for years and years practiced a parasitic and cynical brand of predatory capitalism that leaves nothing to be admired

Ethics

Not a priority

In fact my behavior may have bordered on criminal

And to those I have wronged by this I apologize

But apologies are cheap arent they

There must be a reckoning

Which is why today here in this public forum I call for the attorney general of the state of California to launch an immediate investigation of my conduct as CEO of Hooli  CROWD MURMURING

 leaving no stone unturned

The truth must finally be revealed

I apologize for putting you all through this especially those of you who actually lead lives of real virtue

 SIGHS

 CROWD MURMURING

Hey Gavin

I know that wasnt easy

Sure about that

Shouldve taken the 10 million Richard

Enjoy the injunction thumbass

What

Okay Donny

Yeah you too and I appreciate it by the way

All right I'll catch you on the flip side

SIGH

Okay so this is real

The AG just told me theyre launching an investigation into Gavins price fixing and anticompetitive behavior while he was at Hooli and Gavin called it

So obviously the first move is to file an injunction against any further merging between Hooli and Pied Piper

Okay

Wwhat does injunction mean

 What does that mean

 It means until this investigation concludes you are prohibited from mixing any more Hooli chocolate with the Pied Piper peanut butter

We'll were in the middle of merging our codebases

 Yeah unmerge them

 We'll thats impossible

I mean Christ were using HooliPhones in our Hawaii test

So by calling for an investigation into his own behaviors he can kll us

fuckin Gavin Belson

fuckin Gavin Belson

 CHUCKLING

 MOCKING LAUGHTER

Is this fun

Im sorry

Areare you admiring him

You gotta separate the artist from the art Rico

I mean this is elegant you know

This is this is graceful

This is kinda like uh Whats the uh whats the name of that  ballerina dude

 Baryshnikov

 No

 Nureyev

 No  Does it fucking matter Ron

Who cares

Were paralyzed

Were gonna be broke

Shit yeah

And now Gavins gonna be able to buy Pied Piper for pennies on the dollar

He is under investigation right

So something bad can happen to him

Worst case they find he acted in bad faith and then Hoolis gotta pay a big fine or something

But you own Hooli so youd have to pay that fine

fucking ninja

SIGH

Were dead

Gregory Hines

Dancer guy

RUSS Richard Hendricks

 Cool

Great

We'll Ive gotta go inside and tell everyone so No you dont you lucky fuck

CLICKING TONGUE

Lucky fucky

Richard Don Delarenta the AG of California is gonna do whatever the fuck I tell him to do

 Why

 Cause I have dirt on him

Two years ago he had an openandshut case against a guy who committed terrible crimes but he didnt prosecute him cause that guy bribed him and I can prove it

You think the fuckin AG is gonna wanna let the public see that he didnt prosecute a guy who did this

 Oh my God

Holy fuck

 Or this

Or this

Jesus look at that

fuck me

Hold on wait Is that you

Yeah

So is this

This
