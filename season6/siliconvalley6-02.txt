Facebook Google and Amazon exploit our data for profit

I will help you by building an internet of the people by the people and for the people so help me God

CHEERING

You said all that stuff about not collecting user data

 But I am

 I just lied to Congress

Hooli will remain an independent entity even if we have to shed a few divisions and trim a little fat

Gwart has a really good idea but she doesnt have a business plan

Hi Im Jared

We were able to break down all of your misdeeds

This guy is dirty as a dog and we got him

Oh hell yes

Its the greatest data aggregating platform

And Richard developed it specifically for us

DINESH So this morning Colin cut a new build of Gates of Galloo to his staging server

Okay um this is Baldereach capital city of Galloonia

Those are some ghoul knights wearing gelatinous armor

This is just the game pretty standard stuff

Well until I turn on the microphone

How are you doing Richard

Are you hungry

 Would you like some pizza

 GAME CHIMES

What the fuck

Hes using our API to run ads directly in the game engine

GILFOYLE Crazy right

Dominos Pizza in a fantasy medieval universe

Why its enough to make you wanna go on vacation

GILFOYLE And hes even using our ability to track sentiment

Yeah

Even if I say nonsense words it assigns them an emotional value

Lalalalalalala

RICHARD fuck me

So unless we get rid of Colin which we cant he is going to put this on our network

Money just perverts everything

At this point I could stand to be a little perverted

Yeah I wanna be a lot perverted

I wanna blow money while it talks to its wife on the phone

 I wanna suck money Oh

 All right

 Microphone

 DINESH Oh

Uh Kittens puppies United Nations

THEME MUSIC PLAYING

Silicon Valley 6x02 Blood Money Richard is this an okay time

 I can come back

 No

No no its fine

What do you got

SIGHS

What is this

Its my resignation letter

Im leaving

What

One gaff with Colin and youre just gonna walk away

Its about so much more than that Richard

Ive been agonizing over this

Not sleeping not eating I completely forgot my godsons 40th birthday

Richard Pied Piper isnt the same company that I signed up for

She has different needs now and so do you and it turns out so do I

Okay Jared we are in the middle of a shit storm here

Im trying to handle this as honestly as possible

Theres a founder at the hacker hostel and she needs my help and once Im free of encumbrances Encumbrances

Oh

Well fuck me Jared

I dont want to encumber you

CHUCKLING

Okay

Go to your new boss

I hope shes not a big of a fuckup as I am you buddyfucker

 Im not a buddyfucker

 Oh yes you are Jared

You are a buddyfucker

I am your buddy and you are fucking me

Ergo you are a buddyfucker

Goodbye

 Richard Im not  Goodbye Jared

Thank you

I like it how it is

But its too warm

I want it warm

QUIETLY Okay

INHALES

Gentlemen and lady a short time ago I reached out to you and asked you to invest sight unseen in a newer leaner and more focused Hooli

And invest you did guided not by traditional spreadsheets or actuarial tables but by your own highly attuned financial Gavin cut the bullshit

What do we still own

Mr Skelton

As candid and as forthright as ever

 Age has not dulled one iota of  Gavin

Of course

I had prepared a presentation but I suppose I can just skip to the end

Hopefully I wont lose you

CHUCKLES

Okay Confucius John Lennon Nietzsche Ayn Rand Steve Wonder and here we go

As you can see among the many jewels still in Hoolis crown are our exciting suite of office Where is web services

Well Mr

Bezos felt it would fold nicely into his AWS so he insisted Smart speaker and inhome

 He took that too

 HooliHome was indeed subsumed  by the Amazon Alexa  Targeted search

Ironically also missing

But we maintain rights to the HooliPhone and its proprietary apps the patent for the Hooli Puck Mouse

We also maintain our webbased marketplaces including our upandcoming lifestyle networking platform  Foxhole

 What the fuck is that

Well Foxhole is a very exciting webbased exchange catering to those in the military who are interested in having  extramarital affairs

 SKELTON Gavin when do you expect the eight of us will recoup our investment

Ah yes

Thats my very next slide

 After this one

 CLICKS

Well with a little luck well be profitable and up 5X inside three years

You got three months or youre out

So Melanie will take on all of Jareds marketing duties Gwen will cover biz dev and that should take care of it

Does this scan to you

 I can see it

 Okay great

 RICHARD Okay back to work

 TRACY Uh Bertram while I have you You dont have me

Richards just tasked me with streamlining productivity and balancing headcount

Can you explain to me why you have no one working under you

It just seems odd considering that the agile board is showing that you have a massive backlog

Youre new here so I'll forgive the patronizing tone

Im more concerned with being right than being fast and I dont like dealing with people

To wit  are we done

 Oh youre that guy

What guy exactly

The brooding arrogant guy who refuses to take orders

Selftaught coder who looks down on anyone whos taken a class

Youre probably an atheist or something more contrarian

You claim to be an anarchocapitalist but you work here and pay taxes

Youve probably read half of Neal Stephensons Cryptonomicon and its about 5050 whether you own a snake

WHISPERS His girlfriend owns a snake

I finished Cryptonomicon and you easily couldve just looked in my file

I didnt need to

 Im assigning you five coders

 Inadvisable

Noted

I'll send them over first thing tomorrow

If youre going to throw five randoms under me at least let me pick my team

 Fair enough

 Good

 DENPOK Georgia

 Mm

You want to move the entire company to Georgia

Why

Well the Valleys become prohibitively expensive

Look at these numbers

If we move to Georgia we can save a fortune and get a further investment

Its the only way

Well I have heard good things about the food scene in the Dirty South

Stankonia

Freaknik

Might be nice to be around more people of color

GAVIN What

Not Atlanta

Tbilisi

The country of Georgia not the state

What

 DENPOK Gavin

 Hmm

Tbilisi is no doubt a wonderfully rustic place but do you not fear losing a local presence a connection with the beating heart of the technology industry

HOOVER Boots on the ground so to speak

I think its wise sir

Shit

Youre right

I need to be here to maintain my relevance

All right then

Plan B

You two and the team will move to Belarus

If we can get close enough to the Chernobyl exclusion zone its a buyers market and with the money we save from substantially downgrading from Tbilisi plus the bigger Belarusian investment weve been offered I'll maintain a piedÃ terre here in town

Now I'll need to rely much more heavily on you because you probably wont see me much

I'll need you to guide the troops and bridge the language gap but God damn I respect the hell out of you both

 MONICA Are you sure about this

 CLEARS THROAT

Uh Yeah

Yeah no

We cant have that atrocious game anywhere on our network

 We have to do a raise

 Well its a terrible time to do it but I mean its your call

Its gonna have to be a big number though

Yeah good

I guess we should set up some meetings yeah

MONICA Too timeconsuming

Lets jumpstart the process

Are you feeling charitable

Just 39 cents a day can literally feed an entire family like this

Think about it then ask yourself  NOISY CHATTERING

 MELLOW JAZZ PLAYING

All right so this place is the whos who of VCs so lets do a lap take inventory and well start with the biggest firm work our way down to  Laurie

 Monica

Richard

What are you doing here

The same as you I suppose

Eating caviar and hacking famine

 No I thought you moved to China

 Mm

The interesting thing about moving Monica is that you can do it more than once

I am back

You may be intrigued to know that I have severed ties with Yao and YaoNet

So youre going back to VC

Oh no

You misunderstand

I have severed ties between Yao and YaoNet

Yao has been exited and I have made myself the CEO of the company which I am moving back to the US and in order to make it sound more American I am renaming it YaoNetUS

Wait

So youre launching here

Yes and with those Chinese out of the way I can finally be more ruthlessly efficient

Speaking of excuse me

 What

Are you fucking kidding me

 Richard relax okay shes got inferior tech shes got no developers

You remember when she tried to run Eklow

Shes gonna last a week as CEO

I mean look at her

Shes desperate

Shes already in total flirt mode

I do believe with proper management MONICA She needs money just like we do

Lets just worry about us okay

I will introduce you and just let me do the talking okay

Dont speak until Richard Hendricks from Pied Piper

 Eric Rivera Graves Partners

 RICHARD Oh

I saw your congressional testimony and I thought man I really need to talk to that guy

Oh you did

Huh cool

Yeah

I mean you committed to a really bad business model on national TV

I guess I just wanted to know what the hell were you thinking

I mean picking a fight with Facebook is one thing but sh1tting on Google and Amazon at the same time in front of TV cameras

What was going on in your brain

Andand Hooli

II shit on them too so I mean were all sitting in front of the TV in our office thinking this is the dumbest man in tech

And then we talked about it and we realized hang on  that is totally unfair

 Yeah you did

Good

Yeah because I mean you were subpoenaed right

You were under oath

What were you supposed to do

Technically I dont You werent you werent under oath

Mm I dont think so

Are you kidding me

Wait

Karl Ben

Come over here

You gotta hear this

We were wrong man

Tell them what you just told me

CHATTERING

Hey um Richard Hendricks from Pied Piper yes

Uh no

Maximo Reyes

I am an investor from Chile

Wow I gotta tell you it is an honor to meet you man

Truly I am such a big fan of your technology

Wow

 What like really or  Of course

Hi

We are shaking hands

Correct

But Im sure you have more important people to talk to you know and you have made it painfully clear that you do not want me as an investor so No hhold on

Wait III made it clear

When did I Oh no not you personally but I spoke with somebody from your company many times

Uh Yarez

Yarez

YYarez Dun Yarez Oh

 Jared

 Yes

 Whatever  Potatoes potatoes

Well uh Yared doesnt really work with us anymore so  Oh wow

Well then

 Yeah

Look at you and me

 We are talking

 LAUGHS

Have you ever had a Chilean terremoto

 HOOVER Denpok got a minute

 DENPOK Yes

I may have a way to keep us here in the US

Talk

Are you familiar with CIFIUS

Yes

No

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the US or CIFIUS is a federal agency that has wide latitude to prevent American companies from doing business with foreigners if theres a national security threat

Are you familiar with the dating app Grindr

No

Yes

Last year CIFIUS reversed the sale of Grindr to Chinese investors

They ruled that the sexual and HIV status of US citizens was something they needed to keep out of the hands of foreign interests

 I understand

 This morning I was on the user database of Foxhole when I happened upon a familiar face

CLICKS

Fourstar General Hanley Barris

That is not his face

No it is not

But as a fourstar general he could anonymously compel CIFIUS to prevent Foxhole or its ownership from moving to foreign soil

No more Belarus

I think General Barris would be very keen to keep this type of material out of the hands of foreign interests and by that I mean his wife Yekatarina

Hey

What happened to you last night

Oh my God you reek of booze

Were you out all night

Monica  I got lucky

 Didnt need to know that

No no I got even luckier than that

Tell me did you know that the national tree of Chile is the piÃoner

Also this  do you know who Maximo Reyes is

 Yeah

The richest man in Chile

Well I saw that very tree in the middle of his living room and he let me climb it

You met Maximo Reyes and you went to his house

Yeah and he showed me his art collection and we drank a number of terremotos which are fucking disgusting

Anyway I may have convinced him to give us enough money to get rid of Colin

Wait what

I casually floated 50 million and he didnt even bat an eye

 CHUCKLING

 MONICA Richard Theres a reason Jared tried to ditch this guy

 We cannot take his money

 Why not

Did he tell you where he gets it from

How his grandfather was the chief of secret police under Pinochet

About how they ran their mines

They were basically slave traders

He cant really be all that bad

I mean he really really likes Pied Piper

Look we cannot take blood money

You thought selling ads were bad

These guys executed people in soccer stadiums

I was open to it at first but Jared was adamant and hes right

Fifty million sounds great but its an awfully low price to pay for your integrity

fuck

Look I know Colin is a sleazebag but at least hes temporary

Okay Maximo is a thousand times worse and he would be permanent

PHONE CHIMES

SCOFFS

Of course

He just emailed me the term sheet

I dont even wanna look at him

Just forward it to me

 I'll take care of it

 Thanks

I know that this sucks but I promise you youre doing the right Fifty million

Do you remember when I was offered 10

 LAUGHS

 Richard

Hmm

Its not 50 million

Is it more

Its a billion Richard

A what

He just offered us a billion dollars for 10

fuck

 EXHALES

 Youre already holding a cigarette

TRACY Mr

Gilfoyle

 GILFOYLE Yes maam

 Is this your new team

It is

Five people as you requested

 That man over there

 GILFOYLE Ken

 Isnt he the coffee guy

 Barista

Yes

And Joyce was watering the plants

Mona was working security

Dan and George they were painting the lobby

Until today

Which reminds me they all need to change their LinkedIn status to placaters of middle management

I'll be honest this is sort of a first

And here you thought I was just that guy

You know Mr

Gilfoyle youre right

Youre not that guy because at the seven companies Ive helped take public every other that guy accepted their limitations took on a team and managed to get their work done

Some of them are now billionaires

None of them wouldve gotten into a dickmeasuring contest with HR when they were two weeks behind

So lucky us I guess youre unique

You know Gilfoyle when I first heard the phrase dickmeasuring contest I thought it was a contest to see who could measure the most dicks

But it isnt is it Gilfoyle

Is it a typo

Maybe its a typo

Its not a typo Richard

Its spelled out in the offer

One billion dollars in one lump sum

Okay what do I do

 I dont know

 Oh

Okay well Jared had you pretty convinced that this was evil money

Its a billion fucking dollars Richard

Okay so does that make this less evil or like  way more evil

 Ack

Do not touch

Its an esign

You touch that button its over

Tell me what to do

Monica this is your job

Look when my sister got pregnant her freshman year of college I said get an abortion

Well now my niece Dakota who is very much with us calls me Aunt Abortion

Im sorry

You are the CEO this is on you

Well I gotta talk to Dinesh and Gilfoyle

No you cant talk to those animals

You say a word to anyone out there and this whole company turns into Lord of the Flies in five seconds

Its a billion dollars Richard




    push

Im sorry

Youre on your own

Monica Richard there is a major emergency

Gilfoyle is using the barista as one of the coders so I tried to use the cappuccino machine on my own and I dont know if like the frother knob is like jammed or something but its like not working

So there is no froth at all for anybody

So can you get on that

 Yeah

 Okay great

 Hes on it

 SIGHS

Its really a shit sandwich

Theyve been in there for a while

 Wonder how its going

 DOOR OPENS

General Barris

 Wonderful

 Say hello to your wife for me

Huh

What are you doing here

CLEARS THROAT

Do you have a second

Yeah yeah

Come on in

I know you tried to keep Maximo away from me but one thing lead to another andand now this

 That is quite an offer

 Yeah

So what do I do

Look Richard I know you said Monicas checked out on this but this is kind of a monumental Pied Piper matter

I think you should get advice from somebody within the company

Thats why Im here Jared

Thats you

You gotta come back

 Richard  II know your job changed over time but we can undo that

You know restructure your role move you upstairs so youre closer to me

Whatever it takes to make it work

Come on think about it

Well be a pair of boys back in business

Richard its too late

I mean you know you let me go so I took the job here  with Gwart and  So

Go inside and tell Gwart youre leaving

Well thats not how loyalty works

I mean that wouldnt be fair

Fair

Years ago you came to this house begging me for a job and I gave you one

In fact I made you COO

And now when I need you the most you stab me in the back and you have the balls to lecture me about loyalty

Are you fucking kidding me

I was right

You are a buddyfucker

 Please stop saying that

 Buddyfucker

Stop saying that

Andandand please just leave this house or I cant be held responsible for my behavior

Oh yeah

You finished all of it

In just 24 hours

I did all by myself

CLICKS

I'll take that apology now

Mr Gilfoyle you said that I had to choose

You said I could have it fast or I could have it right but I just got it fast and right and all I had to do was threaten your manhood by assigning you other coders

It worked at seven other companies and it obviously worked here

Were back on schedule

Now why would I be sorry about that

I respect your skills

Thank you

See you in the morning

MAXIMO And now we are both holding  a whiskey

 Yes

Um Maximo I wanna apologize for coming over here unannounced

And I wanna do this deal with you but Jesus Richard you have some concerns because of my family

I mean yeah

Richard do you see these photographs

Now these people a lot of them children used to work for my father in my familys mines

Now I keep them here as a reminder of the many many mistakes my father made

I want to fix those mistakes Richard

By investing in you and your company I'll be able to start doing that

Do you really believe that

Richard we are going to change the world you and I

 THUDS

 Shit

Ah the birds

You know theyre attracted to the tree so sometimes you know kapffft

 We  Uh sorry

No

That is coming to an end

That doesnt happen anymore
