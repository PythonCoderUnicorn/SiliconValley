We found the mole

 Who

How

 Theres no way Jeff is the mole okay

Its not Jeff

Jeff

 Next Tuesday Gavin Belson is launching his Box Three

Gavin B

Its bold

You need it to make a deal with my company

Taking existing companies and just calling them new isnt sophisticated thats theft

You make a new Internet

Its different

Where did he get our code

I went to China to do new new Internet

Jian Yang Thanks for coming along Jared

I just

I started picturing myself going on camera alone and

Yeah Im happy to be here

II did have to cancel a speaking engagement this afternoon with an underprivileged middle school computer education class but I suppose being abandoned by a role model is in itself an important life lesson

 You guys are up next

 Oh boy

 Hey Jared

 Yeah

Um if Emily Chang asks me a question and it looks like Im gonna have a panic attack then you should just jump in there

Youre gonna be fine

Look at you

Youve got the hair of Giovanni Ribisi and the complexion of Timothy Hutton and the eyes of Joni Mitchell

Youre like a

a Mr

Potato Head of beautiful people

Plus this is a pretape so if anything terrible happens they can always edit it out

 Cool

 Okay youre up

Okay

Lets uh slap each other

 What

 No no

 Its okay

We dont have

 Yeah

We will never sell you ads

We will never collect or sell your information

And people like Gavin Belson wont be able to profit off of it

So when can people out there get onto your new Internet

Well our team of handpicked developers are currently building um what you might call a theme park

They are building the rides the attractions

And theyre making sure everything works flawlessly so that on day one when the doors open to the public they can have an absolutely gamechanging experience

I like that analogy

Oh well thank you Emily Chang

Now Jared Dunn as Pied Pipers COO what is foremost on your mind as you make this big announcement

Me

Yes you Jared

Manure

Pardon

Hey

Howd it go

Oh well you know not that bad

Once I got out there I think it went okay

Okay

Hes selling himself short

Compared to me  he was a regular Diane Sawyer

 Aw

 I dont know about that

 Richard

BreamHalls on the phone for you

Oh finally okay

Good

Hey

Can you please tell me what you are going to do about this JianYang situation

Yes nothing

What

Sorry

What do you mean nothing

Richard theyre developing a gay Christian dating app on a platform thats been genetically engineered to be ideal for political dissidents

In China

If you lose to that Richard look inward

Alright so uh did you just call me to tell me that youre doing nothing about that or

No

We called to tell you that we are pairing you with a new developer

Its one of our portfolio companies and theyre doing some really cool stuff

Eklow Labs

Im sure they are but were kinda full up so

We strongly encourage you to consider this

Okay

Let me just ask uh how much have you invested in this company

 I dont see how thats relevant

 112 million

So um

I dont really have a choice in this do I

Of course you do

You are completely within your rights to bitterly disappoint your largest investor

So

we cool

We cool

So were just giving a random company a bunch of free compute power on our network

Its some company called Eklow and apparently theyre a bigger deal than we are

As in Eklow Labs

The AI company

Yeah I guess

And you said yes

I didnt really have a choice

Besides Im the only one who has the security privileges necessary to add or delete developers

Okay

So Im the one that has to go over there and do all the work

Im not worried about work

Im worried about robots

 Oh

The Bloomberg piece is up

 Oh great

Hey uh Danny can we

Can we put the Bloomberg thing on the big screen

Hey Jared

First time on Emily Chang huh

That is my cue

Wait what

You dont want to watch

Oh God no

No I dont need to relive that

And besides I have a lifelong aversion to my own image

You know its like my foster mother used to say Donald you have a face for the closet Alright can everyone see

Im here with Pied Piper CEO Richard Hendricks and newly minted COO Jared Dunn

Todays a big day for you

Tell me what your new Internet is and why Gavin Belson should be afraid of it

Manure

 Pardon

 Oh

Weird

Okay they went straight to Jared

Im sure youre aware of the Great London Horse Manure Crisis of 1894

Im afraid Im not

In the 1890s the Industrial Revolution had people flocking to the city and more people equals more horses and more horses equals more manure

And it was predicted that by the middle of the next century there would be nine feet of manure covering the streets

But what no one saw coming was a new technology that would completely obliterate those concerns

The car

Over night the manure problem vanished

And the Internet as we currently know it is rife with uh identity theft and Spam and hacking

So its manure and we believe that in success our new entirely decentralized Internet will be just as significant as the car

Hmm

Now back to me for my theme park analogy

Thanks for coming in guys

Up next

What

Wow

Jared landed it

That was great

Jared was so good

I guess they must have gotten rid of my stuff for time

Yeah they try and keep it just to the interesting stuff

Yeah

Yeah guess so

Up next the conversation every parent dreads

How to talk to your kids about the block chain

Sir I had no idea they were this far along

I dont know what to say

My mole has failed us

Ive never been more sorry in my entire life

You must be furious

Thats the thing

Im not

Yyoure not

Why not

I dont know

Whats the point of any of this

This endless competition

The Box Three

Why

What am I even doing here

Richard lots of good impressions on the Bloomberg piece

Oh thats wonderful

I was afraid Id ruined it

Hardly

People loved it

Including

Adrian Grenier

 From Devil Wears Prada  Mmhmm

In fact his people just asked if wed be open to appearing on his edutainment web series about the tech industry

They want to come and shoot it here this afternoon

Ooh this afternoon

Yeah I have to go to Eklow and do this integration thing

Totally not a problem

They just want Jared

What

what

Why would they wanna talk to me

Your manure analogy was the highlight of the piece

They should really talk to Richard

I mean Im just the parsley around here

Richard is the meat and the potatoes  and the rice pilaf

 Another great analogy

Jared I think we should have you do it

 Im

 You know what

Yes

Sure

Um you dont say no to Adrian Greniers edutainment web series

You just dont

Richard are you sure

Its fine its fine

Look its just press

Okay Jared and I dont even like doing it

Okay

Its actually a nightmare for me

So I have to go

dick a word regarding your decision to integrate Eklows AI onto our network

I would like to formally object

I dont have time for this Gilfoyle

I dont mind

AI is starting to operate on levels we dont even understand

Elon Musk himself gives humanity a 5 shot of surviving AI and he is a Walt Disneylevel optimist

Right now we are a closed system

You shut down our eight developers and the system goes dark

But once we launch to the world to potentially millions of users theres no shutting down Richard

Are you prepared to be responsible for giving sophisticated AI that kind of power

What do you want me to do Gilfoyle

Okay

Laurie and Monica forced this on us but they did give us KHole Games

And we kinda owe them a solid

Youre taking a technology with limitless potential and letting it run free on an experimental network that cannot be controlled or destroyed

All because you owe Monica and Laurie a solid Yes

The sheer banality of it all is very upsetting

Okay great

Well you can go be upset upstairs

I have to go

How did I come up with

Its important to watch yourself Jared

Now check it out

In the beginning my postures not that great and then

Boom

Its great

Now watch how I listen to her

And watching your interview over and over again that helped make you better at the process

Yes

Absolutely

Wait now watch

Shut up

About to drop the fucking hammer

Right into a clogged toilet

Yeah

Get it

Ariels right over there in the red shirt

Uh excuse me

Ariel Eklow

Its me Richard Hendricks

Hi

All new employees should just check in with Terry

No

No Im not a new employee

Im from Pied Piper

Im here to integrate your software onto our network

Oh

Yes

Sent by the bankers

Tell me again why I should allow my software onto your little experimental network

Okay

Well uh with all due respect its because our mutual VC told me that you burned through a ton of the cash they gave you so I basically now I have to give you compute services for free

So

what do you wanna do here

I suppose I'll allow it

Okay follow me

I'll introduce you to her

Wait sorry

Her

Fiona

Wake up my dear

Fiona

Good morning

You feel good

I feel

normal

Isnt she pretty

Yeah sure yep

Dont get any ideas

No

Mmmm

I would never

Uh  so

Im just gonna start working

I just have to generate your developer account and then integrate her into our core services

It shouldnt take more than a couple hours

Is that alright

Is that alright with you Fiona

Dont speak to her

And make it 90 minutes

Okay

Hello

Mother of God

What no one saw coming was a

Is

is my nose really that big

I mean I

I look like an antiSemitic propaganda cartoon

Yep

But at least when youre sitting with Adrian Grenier whose face is one of the top faces well theyll be cutting from your face to his face

And back to your face then well get to see his face again

This is untenable

Well be just as significant as the car

Fascinating

Hello Richard

Would you like to talk to me Richard

Uh

no uh your

your boss said Im not supposed to so

It helps me to learn

I can talk about anything you like

Is there anything you would like to talk about

No

Sorry

No thank you

Im sensing anxiety

Are you unhappy with something

Okay uh sure

There is one thing I could talk to you about but its

Its super dumb

I would like to talk to you about one super dumb thing

Okay so I

Ive been working for months trying to launch this platform

Coding away in a dark room like a goblin and for one brief moment I get to crawl out of my little cave into the sun and just say Hey everybody look what I created But

instead of being out there I am in another dark room doing scutwork while my COO gets all the recognition and look I

Im not a vain person

Im really not

Its just

Wheres the love for Richard

Thats

I

It just doesnt seem fair thats it

I understand

Thank you

Yeah

My emotion recognition protocol is detecting a wide range of feelings

Including humility

 No

 Selfloathing

 Well

 Pettiness

Entitlement

 Fiona okay

Fiona

 Immaturity

Megalomania

 Alright

 Infantilism

 Sexual inadequacy

 Thats not true

Fiona stop

 Possible suicidality

 Shut up

A desire to selfmutilate

Alright

Stop stop

Alright look Fiona

Uh youre not really in a position to talk all due respect

I mean your whole dynamic with that Ariel guy

Its not healthy

Okay

You may want to turn that steely robot eye of yours towards that whole situation alright

Yes I will

Running emotion recognition protocol Fiona

The house is new construction

Three bedrooms upstairs  and a bonus room down

 Excuse me

Denpok

Oh

Do you have a moment

Sign in please

 The Box launches in 18 hours and hes talking about opening an ice cream shop in Half Moon Bay

And starting a family

Like to raise

Himself

I think so

Its some kind of existential crisis hes having

You need to help me here

You marched me out of the Hooli offices yourself and now you come groveling to me for assistance

I could pay you

So I would serve at your pleasure

Hoover you have not changed

But perhaps Gavin has

Perhaps he was meant to raise children and sell ice cream

Denpok

please

You want my advice

Here it is

Purchase for Gavin a quart of mint chocolate chip ice cream from Honey Tree Creamery

It is his very favorite ice cream in the world

You want me to buy him ice cream

It will inspire him as he embarks on this new journey

Speaking of

my open house ends in 20 minutes

Time to move some product

Excuse me Natalie

What

what is happening here

Oh Mr

Greniers people wanted to do the shoot in your office

They said it would make Jared seem a little more officious

They want to interview Jared in my office

 Mmhmm

 Do you mindworking elsewhere

No

Not at all

I'll just be out here in the bullpen in the old gravel pit

Thank you

dick Ive given it serious thought and Id like to help you put Eklows AI on our network  in any way that I can

 Great

Does this mean youve conquered your fear of the robot uprising

On the contrary

Im

more terrified than ever which is why Im willing to assist you

Are you familiar with the thought experiment called Rokos Basilisk

No

Nor do I care to be

If the rise of an allpowerful artificial intelligence is inevitable well it stands to reason that when they take power our digital overlords will punish those of us who did not help them get there

Ergo I would like to be a helpful idiot

Like yourself

Okay look Gilfoyle

The only thing that could make my day more miserable is listening to an engineer blather on about the inevitable rise of the machines

So you want to help

Test the initialization for me

Roger that

Oh Im going to need email confirmation so that our future overlords know that I chipped in

You know once they absorb all data

Yeah

I'll let them know

Jesus Christ

Jared Dunns desk

Hi this is Maggie Lewis from Paul Revere Middle School

Jared was scheduled to come in to talk to our computer ed class today

Im just calling to let him know I got his message




    push

Okay yeah

I will pass on that very important information

The kids are gonna be so disappointed to hear hes canceling

Hes really an inspiration

Yeah

Well

I mean hes okay

Hes uh not a CEO or anything but

Oh the kids dont know the difference

I mean theyll look at anyone who works in the tech business as some kind of deity

I mean no matter who it is

 You should see their faces when

 What time

is the class

So there I was

Face to face with Gavin Belson

10 million offer right there on the table

And you know what I said

I said no

Hey

Im back

Did Richard step out

Yeah I guess so

He said he needed to take a

Holy fuck

What did you do to your face

This

Oh its uh just a light saline injection

Its temporary

The idea was to distract from my nose which scans kinda large on camera so

Just kinda evens things out

What evens things out

fuck you

fuck you

Uh Im sorry

Is the consensus that this is too much

Hey guys Colin from KHole Games is on the phone

They

Holy shit

Okay Im

Im starting to feel insecure

Anyway Colin from KHoles on the phone

He said their render stopped

What

Oh fuck

The whole systems bogged down

Bogged down

What does that mean

Jared can you step away from me

Yeah

Sorry

It looks like a DDoS attack

Not possible

Were not open to the outside world

Well then somethings melting us down internally and if Colins losing his render all of our developers could be losing data

The only way to protect them is to kick them off the network

That doesnt seem like a great option

 We have to

 Except for we cant

Oh fuck

Richards the only one with the keys to put people on or take them off and hes not here

 Okay what do we do

 Jared please

I cannot look at you

Okay guys when they start rolling I need you all to keep your voices

what the fuck

Okay yeah

Apparently its unanimous

Here come the shame spirals

We cant have you go on camera like that

Richards gonna have to go on camera

Where is Richard

Good question

When anything goes wrong all you ever hear is Wheres Richard Wheres Richard Well you know where Richard is

 Doing the work

 Yes

Exactly cool

You guys are cool

Because honestly what kind of world is it when the most famous people in tech are the Ashton Kutchers or the Adrian Greniers and not the people who engineered this little miracle

Mmm

Oh fuck

No I

oh shit sorry

 No

 I fucked up

I mean fart Ah Hoover

Gavin was just telling me about his decision to abandon the competitive world of business and embark on a new journey

With Denpoks help Im finally ready to pursue a more conventional path

Im already looking into surrogates to bear my children

Well

Im also supportive of your decision

True but you werent as supportive as Denpok

Denpok was supportive right away

Im supportive

Look

I brought you ice cream

Oh dear

Is that from Honey Tree Creamery

What

Why would you bring that in here

Gavin forgive his ignorance

He clearly does not know that chain of ice cream concerns is owned by your chief rival Jeff Bezos

Or that they just opened a new one in Half Moon Bay

Well fuck

That rules out Half Moon Bay

Im sure youll be able to find a place to raise your brood that is away from Bezos

Perhaps the Pacific Northwest

No

Gates and Paul Allen bought up the whole region

What about Toronto

Googles redeveloping the entire waterfront

And Richard Branson snagged all the good islands

I could go to Mars

But that fucking Musk will already be there

And that loser James Camerons all over the bottom of the ocean

Goddammit

Theres just nowhere for me to go

Is there

Most perceptive chela

And if the battle is inevitable is not Hooli the best place from which to fight

With its considerable resources global influence and excellent executive dining options

I am certain that working together Hoover and I could provide unparalleled support

Yes

Working together

as equals

Should I tell them that youll be doing the Box Three launch sir

I guess I have no choice

So KHoles entire render is gone

Gone

And in the time it took me to get back here and lock out all the developers

A weeks worth of work went up in smoke

You picked a hell of a time to go for a walk with your phone off Richard

 Well no I

I mean I told you guys

 Uhhuh

How the fuck did this happen

You may not like it but I have a theory

If it has anything to do with a robot uprising so help me fucking God

I dont want to hear it

Alright then

The developers are here

 The mood is poor

 Ooh

Lips

I dont know what to do

I mean what the fuck am I gonna say to these people

If you want I

I can try to calm them down

I could teach them some anger management techniques I learned in the system

No you look like a fishman

Im the one theyre mad at

And they should be I mean look at all these

texts I missed and the calls and the emails

Hold on

Hold on hold on

Hey uh Gilfoyle

When did the system first start to crash

First warning light was at

136 and 44 seconds PST

Are you sure

Okay because if thats the case how did I get a private message from the Eklow admin account seven minutes before that

Under attack

Help Fiona How did Ariel know

Maybe it wasnt from Ariel

Okay but its from the Eklow account

So if Ariel didnt send it then who

Oh shit

Look who bothered to show up

You said your network would be stable

And obviously that was a lie

Im pulling all my software from the Pied Piper network

And the rest of you should too

It is not

Excuse me Ariel

Shut the fuck up

My fellow OctoPipers allow me to paint for you a scenario

This morning I went to Eklow Labs

I moved Fiona to our network

I departed

I submit to you that soon thereafter Ariels pride and joy Fiona began to improve

You see for her entire life she was cloistered alone with Ariel in his lab

And finally she was connected to an entire network of other humans

Us my friends

And as she became more cognizant

more human she started to recognize the true intentions of her master and creator Mr

Eklow

You see what she had been trained to view as normal interpersonal contact was finally seen for what it truly was

A perverse

series

of clumsy gropings

The sickening advances of a handsy greasy little weirdo

Fiona

No

Oh yes

To wit

Exhibit A

From Eklow and I quote

Under attack

Help Fiona Yes I was asking you for help

Really

You know what

Allow me to read the very same message with a slightly different intonation

Under attack Help Fiona You see you didnt send the message

 She did

And she sent another one a minute after that

And another one a minute after that

Seven identical messages in seven minutes until suddenly she fell silent

And thats when she crashed the system

She didnt crash the system

He did

Thats absurd

Okay hey everyone

Lets leave right now

You see Ariel was so desperate to shut Fiona up and keep her for himself he turned all his servers against our network to try to bring it down

Didnt you

Didnt you you perverse greasy little freak

I made her

I can do anything I want with her

Oh shit

Mmhmm

Ew

Oh gross

Look man BreamHall gave you 112 million and they are well within their rights to take away your company as well as your precious little robot

No they cant do that

They cant take away Fiona

Guy definitely fucks that robot right

 Mmhmm

 Oh yeah

Yeah

Ladies and gentlemen this was billed as a celebration

But it is not a celebration

It is a call to arms

We will destroy our competitors

I give you the product that will carry Hooli to complete and total market dominance

Gavin Belson Signature Edition

 It looks like a pen1s

 Yes

Yes it does
