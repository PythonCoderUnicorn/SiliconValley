What are we talking about here

You want us to launch a cryptocurrency

BERTRAM GILFOYLE You wanted an alternative to Laurie Bream

Pied Piper Coin

Mm

I promised Richard that we would never make him harvest data or sell ads

I am not saying that we will force their hand on this issue but neither am I saying definitively that we will not

Have you received my proposal

RESPONDS IN CHINESE

Very promising

Look Monica I will do the ICO but only if you do it with me

Pied Piper Coin is totally gonna work

Yes

Totally is

BUZZING

MAN Whose idea was this again

Okay everybody

Lets do this

Photo time

Lets go

Frontenders come on in

Wheres my backenders

I see you cryptogeeks

laughing delightedly

Follow me

chuckles

Old Pipey thing

Holden

Are we set

Sorry

I havent used this camera before

enunciating

Are we set

Yes Jared

Look

uh look guys

II know we didnt have the budget we wanted to get here

But we are here

Finally all our hard work has paid off

So now the worlds first totally decentralized internet will be live

in five

Crowd joining in Four three two one

Yeah

Dinesh Richard

Richard

Richard

You have to see this

Whats wrong now

A good thing

chuckles

A good thing has finally happened

Dont fuck with me

quietly

I am not fucking with you

Come come

Look

Look at the user numbers

Wait holy shit

Is that right

I think weve reached the inflection point

We made it

Dont just

dont

Yeah

Richard Well I think this calls for a little celebration

I just knew that if we kept plugging away eventually wed get some traction and reach an inflection point

What did I keep saying

Give us time and then well climb bitches

Richard Yes Holden

Thats right except for the bitches part but yes

And now we are gaining almost 12000 users an hour

cheering

fuck yeah

You get a high five and you get a high five

fuck yeah

I wanna give a quick shoutout to my seven developers my Septapipers who stuck with us through thick and thin unlike KHole which took their game and totally bailed on us

crowd booing

Lock them up

Lock them up

Jesus Jared

You really did a number on that kid

God

Yeah

I just chipped away everything that wasnt Richards assistant and this is whats left

Lock them up

theme music playing

So how are things advancing

To date we have manufactured almost 400000 mobile devices

And we are signing them all onto the Pied Piper network

Yes

Well we have to do it manually

It is slow

But it provides an advantage

They may not know what we are doing until its too late for them to stop us

Indeed

Yeah

To be honest at times I find it difficult to tell what youre thinking

Mmm I see

 Come on babe   Follow me   Im the Pied Piper   Follow me Im the Pied

 Monica Pappy Van Winkle

Im not gonna have to start locking my desk drawer now am I

Hey does this seem odd to you

What

So our user numbers have been growing for days but our coin value is flat

It hasnt budged at all

I thought the two would be correlated at least a little bit

Yeah

Should be

Sorry I dont mean to rain on the parade

I find parades to be impotent displays of authoritarianism

Whose bag is this

Uh

oh

Scoot over

Colin

Hey man

What are you doing here

I like the beard

You throwing a party

Yeah

Something that you and KHole Games couldve been a part of had you not walked out on us

Oh come on man

Laurie was our VC

Shes the one that made me pull the game and bail on you guys

So you just do whatever Laurie says huh

Well she had control of my board

Hmm

Which is exactly how she just managed to fire me

You lost your company

sarcastically

Aw

Bummer

But the cool part is Im free

Which is why Im here

I have been cooking up a solo project on the side for a few years

Its a killer new game

And I was thinking maybe we would launch it on your network

Its a sweet indie RPG

Im calling it The Gates of Galloo I have a ton of presales

If we put this thing on Pipernet bam

Youre gonna have 80000 instant users

snaps fingers

What do you say

You and KHole pull your game

A game that was the central element to our launch strategy

And then literally days after everything starts to fucking come together you stroll on in here and act like nothing ever happened

Stroll

I just walked in here normally

Besides this would help you out too right

You you wanna help me out

You just lost your company

Im in there celebrating with my fucking victory

Dude

Can I be real with you

I really need this

Can I be realer

Kiss my piss

What

You heard me

Kiss my piss

I was hoping youd be cool about this

Oh really

You thought I might be cool Mr

Backwards Hat

Is this cool huh

To do this maybe

I dont know

Kiss my piss

Kiss

my piss

All right I get it

Kiss my piss

I'll see you around Richard

Karmas a bitch Colin

  Oh

Monica hey

Hey

Hey I was just coming in early to clean up for the custodial staff

When did you get here

We never left

We

All right

Good to go

You were both here all night

Our coin price wasnt growing with our user numbers so we coded a diagnostic tool to go through the ledger and figure out exactly where our users are coming from

Yes

We coded it

Youre smoking my cigarettes asshole

In a public workspace in the state of California no less

Shall we

clears throat

This breaks our users down by which developers signed them on

So each bar is one of our seven Septopipers

Wait why are there eight bars

Who whos that

No idea

But whoever it is they are the reason for most of our new user growth

Wait so some nonpiper out there is signing up users to our network en masse

Howd they get access to our system

Without a key from us the only way in is to steal our software

But no one has stolen our software

Except for

Oh shit

loud music playing

cell phone vibrating

Hello

Hey JianYang

Its Big Head

Hows it going man

Hes been in contact with JianYang this whole time

Yeah they play Words with Friends

Cool cool

Listen Gilfoyle wants to ask you a question

No

I dont want to talk to Gilfoyle

Hes a racist and a witch

Im not a witch

Now spit out the kimchi and tell me what the fuck is going on with our network

fuck you

I'll tell you nothing

dealer speaks foreign language

Okay

I'll tell you everything

But I want to move back into the house

I want to come home

Wait what

Its not that big a deal

I mean JianYang could just take Erlichs old room

So

I dont give a fuck about that

So JianYang said Gavin Belson tried to buy our stolen software

Yes but before he could he was outmaneuvered by a Chinese man named Yao

Yao

Who the fuck is Yao

This guy

Hes a Chinese manufacturer who just announced a partnership with guess who

Laurie Bream

She just led a 200 million round for something called YaoNet

So Laurie and Yao are manufacturing phones and signing them onto our network

But why

Why would they wanna help us

Oh shit

Theyre not helping us

Theyre attacking us

Its the 51 attack

Has to be

Im sorry what

A 51

ice rattling loudly

A 51 attack

ice continues rattling

The beauty of our decentralized internet is that no one controls it

But if 51 were controlled by one entity like say Laurie and Yao they could rewrite the rules for everyone

They can delete all of our users all of our developer apps crash our coin

This would be the end of Pied Piper

fuck

Okay

How many devices do they have

typing

Right now they have 45 of our total

And gaining

Wait Gilfoyle

Could you write a patch that kicks all of Yaos users off the network

I would have to rewrite our consensus protocol but I could probably get that done in eight hours

Okay thats good

And and how long do we have till we lose control of the network

At this rate half that

groans

door opens

panting

I just went for a run

I sprinted

up the last bit there

I did open palm

Aaah

WhWhats going on

Richard theres no easy way to say this

JianYang is moving back into the house

Right

Gavin youve staked the entire future of this company on the Signature Box Three

Where are they

Well the last two months have been challenging

The Chinese were petulant

The North Carolinians proved very entitled

And I held out hopes for our experiment in the Yukon Territories

But as it happens the Inuit are surprisingly adept at collective bargaining

But fear not I am in the early stages of a new plan

Did you know that some of Americas most capable motivated laborers are at this moment awaiting execution

Gavin

How many boxes have you actually managed to produce

Well we have the 40 prototypes which weve been using to drive sales

And

And

they are very impressive

I see

I guess its time we tell you

Weve been exploring the viability of an acquisition with Amazon

Rachel The talks are still preliminary but thus far they seem quite promising

You expect me to work for Jeff Bezos

No fucking way

I mean dont take this as any kind of threat but if Amazon buys this company I am out

We spoke to Jeff an hour ago

It sounds like the two of you are on the same page about that

Priyanka start separating legitimate users into their own pool

Becky I need you to ratelimit enemy devices

Danny find shortcuts to deploy a new consensus protocol

Sorry but were never gonna finish in time

Not with that attitude

Yeah we would need to add a shit ton more users immediately

Working on it

Colin hey

Its its Richard Hendricks

Leaving you another voicemail

Um just wanted to talk to you about your game

And uh those uh 80000 users you got there

And also to apologize for last night

You know I was just really wasted

I was so drunk

We had such a crazy party going on

Anyway call me back and well uh well chat some Gates of Galloo Well uh well Galloo it up

Hows that sound

Well just call me back

Okay

Its its Richard Hendricks its

Thank you

Bye

Left another voicemail

Doesnt really matter

Hes gonna be off the grid for the next three days

What

Yeah I just spoke with his girlfriend

Whatever the fuck you said he took really hard

Colin went camping

Alone

Well did she say where he went

The Los Trancos Preserve

Wait

I know exactly where that is

I used to go foraging for mushrooms with my friend Muriel there before she passed away

I could drive up there and and look for him

Its only 20 miles away and they dont really enforce the speed limit

fuck your Volt

I'll drive

What what are you doing

Im borrowing my Tesla

Its my Tesla

I pay for it

And if I dont get to Colin in time Pied Piper ceases to exist

So pretty please with a fucking cherry on top can I borrow the Tesla I bought for you

Can Jared drive

No

Fine

Thank you

footsteps approaching

So

So

were fucked

No were not

Okay we just

We need a few more users to give Gilfoyle some breathing room and

And what if you call Dana from Quiver

He hates me

Everybody does

And to be honest theyre right

Im an asshole

No youre not Richard

Yes I am

Colin was here last night out there in the hallway down on his luck and he was begging me to take his subscribers

And I told him to

kiss

my piss

You what

Kiss my piss

I said it again and again

Oh my God

I did a dance

Okay okay okay

Lets just move on from

this

I am a spiteful vengeful prick

Oh my God Richard

Yes you fucked up

But that doesnt mean youre a bad person

Look at you youre sitting here regretting it

Thats not the move of an asshole

Okay

I mean you think a guy like Gavin Belson just sits around feeling bad about being a dick to people

He doesnt even notice okay

The guys a prick when he was on top and now after everything that just happened hes still gonna be a prick

What do you What do you mean

Everything that just happened

What happened

I just read that Amazons probably gonna be acquiring Hooli

What

Yeah so Gavin Belsons gonna be out on his ass but do you think hes gonna change at all because of it

No hes always gonna be a

prick

Exactly

Okay so stop whipping yourself and lets just figure out what we can do

Hes a prick

Yes

Gavin Belson is a prick

Yeah thats what Im saying

Hes a

hes a total

fucking prick

Wait where are you going

Dinesh How could it be this crowded

Burning Mans in two weeks so people are beta testing their new gear

Why would people who arent refugees choose to come here and live like refugees

You know thats not like a desirable thing right

Living like a refugee

Ugh

This place is offensive to homeless people

Gavin on speaker Hello

Hello Gavin

Its Richard Hendricks

Richard Hendricks

glass clatters

Mind the glass

Yeah

Oh

Its all smashed up again

What do you want Richard

I need your help

Look my network is in trouble

And I know that deep down in your heart what you

Oh for fucks sake

Youre not gonna give me another one of your inspirational in defense of great technology speeches are you

Stand up and fight for innovation that kind of bullshit

No

Exactly the opposite

I happen to know that a man named Yao fucked you over

How would you like to fuck him back

Im listening

I need you to attack me

Gavin on phone John

Its Gavin Belson

Oh

Hello

Listen John

Do we still have the prototypes of my Signature Box Three strung up

Yeah

They told us they were gonna send more but

they never did

Well thats a long story

I got time

Yeah listen John

I need you to give admin access to Richard Hendricks

Becky did you run connection throttling on the latest batch of device IDs

Yes

You know why

Im not a moron

Oh I see

Im the asshole

Really

You really wanna have this conversation

Youre both assholes

Shut the fuck up

The fuck does it matter

Were never gonna finish this patch in time anyway

ding

Wait what the fuck

phone vibrating

just happened

dick where are you

Im at Gavins

I just gave his boxes permission to mimic a shitton of phones on our network

A second attack

Richard on phone Yes exactly




    push

Now Yao cant get to 51

Where are we with the patch

Close but you do realize that now that were below 51 we cant deploy it

For now we cant win

But since Gavin is holding off Yao we cant lose either

He just bought us some time

Okay I'll see you in a bit

Well Gavin thank you very much

You just gave me and my guys a fighting chance

Is that what just happened here Richard

Yes

No

Seems to me you are the one that just gave me a fighting chance

Ni hao

Its Gavin Belson for Mr

Yao

What the fuck are you doing

Jared This is the last road Dinesh

Hes not here

Colin

Colin

Will you shut the fuck up

How would you like to die today mtherfucker

No its not a real death threat sir

Jared Im sorry

Im just stressed

gnfre and screaming

Shut up for a second

You hear that

gnfre and screaming continue

gnfre and screaming continues

So you want us to delete all of our phones

Right now were in a standoff

You cant win but if you back off I can

I have more devices than anyone I will reach 51 and take control of this little shits network

You know can I chime in here

I actually think that this is a bad idea and

In exchange for deleting your principal competition Im simply asking for a partnership between your venture and Hooli

Well hes actually leaving Hooli

Theyre firing him

So I dont know where the connection could for fucks sake

Im sure my board would find an arrangement between YaoNet and Hooli vastly preferable to fire saleing the company to Jeff Bezos

My proposal is I help you in exchange for a 20 stake in your venture

And I have a counterproposal that you do not do that

Gavin

How do we proceed

Because

We like it

klaxon blaring

woman speaking in foreign language

indistinct chatter

  gnfre and screaming continues

explosions and screaming

device beeps

screaming stops

Hey guys

What are you doing here

We tried calling you

A hundred times

Yeah Im off the grid

And

Done

All right so the patch is ready

Indeed

Now maybe someday Dark Lord willing well actually get to deploy

gong rings

Booyah

All of it

Just please dont destroy it

Id rather give it away than watch it die

As much as I hate to admit who better to take it than you Gavin

I mean youre really the only one who realizes what the decentralized internet could be

I find this uninteresting

Can we proceed

You wrote the patent and gave it to me

Hell you hired the best 63 distributed systems engineers in the city

I mean you could build this into what it was meant to be

Gavin enough

Come on you know that my network is way better than some knockoff

And instead of taking a minority stake in their company you could take total control of mine

Why would you turn that down

Lets make it official

I will uh

I will sign my company over to you

Its yours Gavin

You win

Okay

Take it

Just please dont delete it

All our phones are turned off now

Gavin delete Pied Piper immediately or we will walk away

Not if I walk away first

Sorry but this gives me all the cards

I get Hooli back

And fuck the Signature Box Three

I get a complete doover
