Somethings wrong with your frunk

Its all frucked up

Ive instituted an operation to safeguard our interests

Uh Gavin Belsons office please

You wanted me to unite the teams

They are united against me

If Im not inspirational enough for you then theres the door

I'll approve you as the soul beneficiary and the official executor of Mr

Bachmans estate

This is my incubator now

You cant just kick us out JianYang

Wait a second

So the guy who just kicked me out of my house now owns 10 of my company

Technically he kicked you out of his house

And he inherited all of Mr

Bachmans assets including his 10 of Pied Piper

 By faking his death

 Allegedly

Look Richie

You didnt actually lose anything here okay

Bachman is the aggrieved party and if he is actually still alive hell get his 10 back when he shows up

In the meantime is it really any worse if it belongs to this Yang guy

No I guess not

So whats your real beef here then huh Richie

You got something against him

You dont have like a bias against Asians do you

Richard

No I dont

No I just dont like being kicked out of my house

By a

NNothing

By no one

By any race

Yeah Im hearing something different

Youd tell me if you harbored  nativist feelings wouldnt you

 Yes

Dana

Like me

You think that guys like me

I just thought of something

Do you guys want to come to my party

That would be delightful

Okay bye

Mmkay

SILICON VALLEY Season 05 Episode 03 Episode Title  Chief Operating Officer Look at this

This is what theyre asking for a onebedroom apartment in Menlo Park

Oh

What

Well I can comfortably afford my new onebedroom apartment

You and I make the same amount of money

Im just wondering what is the difference

Could it be that I didnt spend all my money on an absurdly overpriced electric car

Gilfoyle

So kind of you to join us

Youre welcome

Yeah

Uh well its uh 200 PM

So fourth day in a row you missed the standup meeting

Correct

Maybe you should hold it later

Okay cause we literally moved it from 900 to 1100 to accommodate you

So do you mind telling us when you feel like you can make it in

Sure

Whenever you hold the meeting  I'll be in an hour after that

 Okay well

What the fuck was that

Uh thats the song You Suffer by Napalm Death

Oh yeah

Thats

thats a whole song

Thats like a second

Its an alert

Whenever the price of Bitcoin dips below a certain value its no longer efficient to mine

When it comes back up it is

So I need to know when it breaks that threshold so that I can remotely toggle my rig at home

Okay

Any idea how often that might happen

Bitcoin is very volatile

So

Thats just so loud

A lot

Good

Alright well

maybe turn it down or something

Oh fuck

Whats up

You guys working hard or hardly working

Youre just standing there

Like a cool cowboy

Hey yeah

II really like your place

Yeah me too

Well he liked it so he bought it

Right

Just like you and that hoodie

So Dana interesting story

Uh the reason Richard has this bandage on his neck and that hes got one on his hand is because he got so exhausted during a code sprint that he walked through a plateglass window

Now II read on Pando that you got injured also early on at your company

You should tell Richard that story

Right

Interesting topic between CEOs

If you want

I mean you dont have to

Alright Im gonna go mingle

Dana told me he invited you

Im so psyched you came

Yeah

I got

I have so many questions for you man

Do you want to grab a drink or do you want to stay here

 There

Yeah

 Oh great

I mean even way back when I was finishing my PhD at MIT I would tell anyone that would listen that a decentralized system was the obvious eventuality

Yep

And now its more necessary than ever

I mean the stuff Google and Facebook are getting away with

Its insane

Totally

Right

Thats why Ive always said that the users data should be in the hands of consumers not the corporations

100 but see that cant happen until someone iterates a functional alternative

Which I believe Richard I believe youre about to do

Well I dont know

Trying to yeah

Have you solved uh colocating data with the compute test

How do you know about that

Do you code

I used to man

Uh yeah I loved it so much but you know I got drawn over to the business side

Richard

There you are

Hey

Jared Dunn

Hi

Ben Burkhardt

Hey Dana

So its 900 AM in Dubai

I gotta make a call so excuse me guys

Oh

So um Dana was just telling me that he prefers a late lunch too

Just like

Is that right

Kind of

Well I see a colleague

I'll leave you guys to

to chat

Cool

Mm

So on the way out Dana told me that he really loved meeting you

He said it went great

Did you not think so

Yeah its just

he didnt really talk though

Yeah

Thats one of his quirks

Hes fun

Hey you know who I did have a good conversation with

 Who

 His COO

Who Ben

Yeah um do you know him

Um not well

I hear hes a very competent executive

But apparently he left Oculus for Quiver in kind of an unprofessional manner

Hmm okay

Well he really loves Pied Piper

Jared come on

This is your condo

Sleep in your bed

Dont be silly

Hey

Uh leave the lights on as long as you want

Uh hey Jared

Yes

Um

Never mind

Uh see you tomorrow morning

Sweet dreams

Right if only

Did I tell you about Gilfoyles terrible song

Yes

Yes you did

And I heard it

Im

Im gonna go clean the rice cooker Dinesh

You know what the worst part is

Hes actually a decent coder

He almost never fucks up

Uh wait almost

One time he royally fucked up but even then he ended up saving the day with all his fridges

Fridges

Seppen Smart Fridges

And you know what

It was totally illegal

Really

I'llegal

So tell me about these fridges

Jeff

I cant tell you that

Its a company secret

Okay um let me get you some more vodka Dinesh

Thank you guys for seeing me on such short notice

Well its an honor to have you Gavin

Back there we test our compressor run capacitors

But here is what Im sure youll be most interested in seeing

This is our smart fridge development team

To be honest we were a little nervous about wading into the Internetenabled market

Over the last 80 years weve built a real trust with our customers

Alright

Great tour

Oh theres a lot more to see

Ugh

Why

Look

I came here to offer you a partnership to cut down your server bills

Oh

Well our server costs were far higher than we anticipated

As we said were not well versed in

The 20th century

Yeah you mentioned that

Do you want to save a fortune or not

Well yes

In exchange I need you to do something for me with regard to the people who hacked your refrigerators

Im going to destroy their lives

So what

Ben So

 So I turned to Bill Gates

 Yeah

Right and I said

I dont know Bill

Maybe you should Google it You said that to Bill Gates

I did

I swear

Hey

can I ask you um

Did you tell Dana that we were having lunch

Richard I told you that Bill Gates story for a reason

I um I practice something called radical candor Which is no matter how uncomfortable the truth is Im gonna tell it to you

And the honest truth is

I did not tell Dana about this lunch

Things with Dana have gotten stagnant

But the other night

talking to you Richard I

I felt that spark again

 What are you saying

 Okay well

The first tenet of radcan Richard is to just

is to just say what you think and so Im gonna do that

Im gonna say what I think and Richard I think we should work together

Oh

You mean like

Like I could be your COO

Um

I dont know

Maybe we shouldnt be doing this

Whoa whoa Richard

Were just talking

You see any numbers written down here

Do you see a Power Point

No we dont even have a laptop

Exactly

Cause were not doing anything wrong

Oh shit

 Party of one

 Sh

Shit

I looked at his calendar and it said he had a meeting

Okay Richard Im gonna continue being honest with you and tell you that I have to leave now through the kitchen

 Okay

 Okay please dont tell anyone  about this

 Okay

What

Hey

Hey Dana

What the heck

Dana right

Oh hi

Im just

Are you having lunch alone

I am

Im totally alone

Uh in fact

do you want to uh join me at my table for one

Oh okay

Sure

Come on over

One beef pot pie

One beef pot pie no carrots

Yep

Here

Put em here

I love beef pot pie

And only kind of like carrots

Oh fuck

Gilfoyle goddammit

Could you please stop that fucking noise

Im serious

How will I know when to remote toggle my rig

Easy you wont and neither will any of us because you wont remote toggle anything

No more remote toggling

Got it

 Just

 Hey

Hey

How was lunch you little minx

What

Yeah you thought I wouldnt find out

I was uh texting with Dana

Just checking in

And he mentioned  that you two met up

 Oh yeah

Yeah

Just just briefly for

yeah

Yeah

III knew you two would hit it off

You know Dana did mention that he thought you might be bulimic

Okay

Great um

Jared do you think its time we hire a COO

Oh

Did Dana suggest we hire someone like Ben

Yeah

Yeah like Ben

You see if you didnt have lunch with Dana this never wouldve come up

I'll put together a list

Great

Um

Richard you should see this

What the fuck

Seppen is suing us for 10 million in damages

The complaint specifically cites sullying their smart fridges with mimesimulated fellatio Our customers invite us into their homes

The kitchen is the modern hearth

We cannot have that trust violated Is that a typo

Do they mean heart

How did Seppen find out it was us

I dont know

You tell us Gilfoyle

You said you pulled all our code and bleached it

Maybe you missed something

No

No way

They have no proof it was us

Ignore them

Ignore them

What the fuck kind of solution is that

No

Hearth Its a word

Huh

We dont need to solve anything

They have nothing

Well Im pretty sure they have something Gilfoyle

So you fucked up somewhere

I didnt fuck up

Well guys Im sure theres something we can do here

Uh just give me a second

Hey sorry

II cant talk right now

Can we meet up

Um my place

Midnight

Okay I gotta go

Okay

Okay so wait

Youre telling me this Gilfoyle guy first hacked into the fridges as a prank

Without your knowledge

Uh yeah




    push

Well there you go Richard

If you didnt authorize it then hes acting as a rogue agent

You tell Seppen that and Pied Pipers off scotfree

Yeah but what would happen to Gilfoyle

I dont know

Thered be criminal and civil charges hed have to deal with on his own

Oh Jesus

I dont know

Sounds kinda brutal

In the end being on those fridges saved us

Richard II told you about radical candor yeah

Well what Im getting from you now is the opposite of that

Its actually something we call ruinous empathy You want to destroy your entire company just to keep one bad actor happy

Thats not fair to you Richard

Oh come on

Gilfoyle will never be happy

This is exactly the kinda thing I could help you with if you hired me

Hey any news

Oh goddammit

Why is that thing still fucking doing that

I guess Gilfoyle forgot to turn it off

Its been doing that all morning

I dont have his password

Bitcoin is really volatile today

Yeah okay

Uh where is he

Well its 1000 AM so not here

Okay you know what

fuck Gilfoyle

fuck him right to hell

Ive been saying that for years

Wheres Jared

Richard are you serious

Yes

Well I concede that laying it all at Gilfoyles feet might get us out of the Seppen lawsuit but

I mean youd really throw him to the wolves like that

That doesnt sound like you

Well maybe Im just becoming a little less ruinously empathetic

Have you been seeing a therapist

No

But

I have been seeing Ben

Ben Burkhardt

Oh Richard no

Hes Danas COO

Youre

Youre jeopardizing your entire friendship with Dana

What friendship with Dana

Who could be friends with that guy

I got news for you Jared

Dana sucks man

Richard

I mean he is a dog

How did he even found his own company

Is he even smart

Okay thats unfair

Look this is your company

And you can work with whomever you want

But I need you to think long and hard about what youre proposing to do to Gilfoyle

Were talking about criminal charges here

He could be deported

There has to be another option

Well no offense Jared but Ben says there isnt

Okay

And he is a worldclass COO that has brought multiple companies to a billion dollars

And youre just a biz dev guy

Im

Im sorry

I

I just think that in this particular situation Ben might know a little better

Okay

Youre the boss

You know but I will say this

If youre really going to start working with Ben at least give Dana the common courtesy of telling him the truth about what you guys are doing

Because if you dont tell him

youre the dog

Thanks for uh having me over

Of course

So its gonna be a bit weird at first

Then its gonna be okay

What

Hi this is Jared Dunn

Um sorry I dont recognize this number

Jared

Come here now

JianYang

So

Ben told me everything

Oh

Uh

Well

Radical candor I guess right

Yeah he told me how you kept texting him nonstop

And he kept refusing but you were relentless

What

 Uh no

 Richard its

Its immaterial

The point is Dana knows everything now

However it came to that its just words in the winds

Words in the winds

Yeah

Well Richard looks like you got what you wanted

Youre both adults

You can work together if you want

I just wish youd demonstrated the measure of spirit to discuss this with me to my face

But

guess theres no honor among thieves hmm

Well

good luck gentlemen

You deserve each other

Dana

Wow

You know Ive never really seen him like that

Hes so assertive

Uh articulate

Yeah hes had a head cold the last couple weeks

Been pretty low energy

Really

Yep

Oh

So I guess

You and me huh Richard

Together at last

Yeah

Dana rides a motorcycle

Yep

Cool

So uh what exactly did you

The witch lost his mind

Gilfoyle you smoke

I kept mulling that Seppen shit

I didnt leave a bit of my code on that fridge

No remnants nothing so how do they know

Then I realized

theyre listening to us

Theyve been listening to us this whole fucking time

Right

All these devices are listening to us

Okay um

Gilfoyle II think you need some rest

Not yet

I checked their firmware and their logs

The fridge is set to record constantly streaming everything back to the cloud

They must have gone through those audio logs and listened to our conversations

Wait even if they arent listening to us just the fact that they could be is interesting

Shit

They make smoke detectors

I think theres one in the kitchen

Those fuckers are listening

JianYang are

Are you copying all those companies for the Chinese markets

Oh no

fuck you Seppen

Hey

Where have you been

Um I stayed at Big Heads last night

Yeah

Oh God Ive been calling all night

Yeah

I just didnt feel like getting reprimanded

II thought maybe you were locked in another Starbucks bathroom overnight

One time Jared

One time

Okay youre just gonna have to catch up on the fly then

On the fly what

Richard Hendricks  this is Tom and Viola from Seppen

 How do you do

Oh hi

Alright uh we wont take up any more of your time

Richard has called you in today because

of this

Um this is Seppens Smart Fridge Terms of Service where you specifically state that only refrigerator commandrelated user data will be uploaded to your clouds service

Thats correct

We believe that the refrigerator is the hearth of the modern

Stop talking

We know your refrigerators are streaming all recorded audio to the cloud

Every single conversation

Which is tantamount to illegal wiretapping

You thought a mime performing fellatio was bad

What happens when your customers find out that every single thing theyve ever said in front of their hearth has been recorded

Oh shit

We never listen to any recordings

Look we never wanted to get into this tech stuff in the first place but our marketing department insisted

Between us

Gavin Belson was the one that pushed us to sue you

Is there something we can do here

This is a deal memo stating that Pied Piper will fix your security issue and update your system to Pied Pipers stack in the future which will lower your server costs and improve the security of your fridges

In exchange you drop the suit

Uh Richard

Did I state that correctly

Is that our offer

Uhhuh

Yep

Id also like to tell you I have a Seppen bread machine and I have never been happier with an appliance

 Pleasure

 Thank you so much

Hey

Im so sorry if I overstepped my bounds

Its just time was of the essence

 Are you kidding me

 Jared you saved us

And you did it without having to fuck Gilfoyle over

 Thanks

 Yeah um

We should talk about what they said about Gavin

Hello Pied Piper

Nice gender mix

Could use a little more color

Baby steps right

Where do you want me

 What are you doing here

 What are you talking about

Well II said Id call you

I didnt say I was hiring you

Richard

II left Dana for you

I know

Ha

Im aware

But

let me try a little radical candor

Um cheating on your CEO and then blaming it all on me is not really the kind of behavior I like to reward

Nor is pushing me to put my friend in jail

 Okay

 You want candor Richard

You are objectively making a huge mistake

Im a worldclass COO okay

And your heavy metal friend

I mean hes obviously a dick

And you know

You know what else Richard

Youre 20 to 30 pounds underweight

Its gross

Who was that

He seemed smart

Hey Richard

Im at least 45 pounds underweight

Okay and dont worry about him

Were gonna find you a much better COO

I think we already have

You want the job

Jared uh

Alright okay

 Im okay

 I know just take it

Everyone can see you

 Oh my God

 Yeah lets have a seat

 Just think about it

 Im okay

Yeah lets

Do you want some water

Just breathe just breathe

Seppen said that Gavin was pushing them to sue us right

Uh yeah but that shouldnt be a surprise

But Seppen had no idea that we broke in

How the fuck did Gavin know

Right

WWWhat

Are you suggesting that

someone in here is leaking info to Gavin Belson

I am

We have a mole on our hands

What the fuck is going on over there

Um yeah bad news

Seppen just left and

and it looks like theyre gonna settle

Hey

Dude

We have a mole

 Sync corrections by srjanapala   You remember KHole James

 Of course

 KHole is euphoric about speaking to you regarding a deal

That would put us months ahead

Whatever you are doing stop it now

This is not a done deal

Any word from our mole at Pied Piper

We found the mole

How did the mole get all this information

By exploiting our most glaring weakness

 You were working As a waitress   In a cocktail bar
