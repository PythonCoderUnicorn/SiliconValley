Oh no

Are you suggesting that someone in here is leaking info to Gavin Belson

Tell me about these

fridges

Do you want to save a fortune or not

Well yes

In exchange I need you to do something for me with regard to the people who hacked your refrigerators

Im going to destroy their lives

Jared do you think its

time we hire a COO

Youre 20-30 pounds underweight

Dont worry about him

Were gonna find you a much better COO

You want the job

All right

Ugh

All right

Okay everybody um thanks for coming

Uh sorry about the venue

We had a minor security issue

I didnt feel comfortable hosting you guys at

at our offices

But hey at least out here we dont run the risk of running into anyone from the tech industry

Yeah theyre all so old

 But they look so happy

 Yeah

Its weird

I dont understand it either

Anyway I wanted you guys to meet because despite being a very diverse and talented group of young web developers

Goodscape huh

Social coding platform

Tholio analytics firm

Plucky music streaming

FirstSight dating site

Gay dating site

Okay technically youre a dating site but specifically a gay one

Which is a subset so Im not wrong

Anyway uh despite all our differences we all have one thing in common right

A signed agreement with me to build and launch your websites not on the tired bloated old web but on the new Internet of the future

The Pipernet

Which is why from this day forward Im going to be naming the eight of you

the OctoPipers

Until something better TBD

So when can we tell people

Soon

Actually very soon

Uh next Tuesday Gavin Belson is uh

launching his Box Three

So um the day before we are going to announce our partnerships with you all and beat him to the punch

Shit

Hes gonna be super pissed

Hes really gonna come after us

Yeah he is but fuck him

Not butt fuck him

 Just

 You dont have to explain that kinda stuff

II know what you mean

Yeah I know

Look

look

As long as we stick together and support each other we can crush him

Because what we are doing is amazing okay

We are building the worlds first truly open truly free decentralized Internet

And I tell you what I got a sneak preview for you guys okay

Because as of this morning  messaging is live

 What

 Cool

 Yeah

Really

So cool

So

right now I will send to you all the very first message ever to be sent on a decentralized peertopeer Internet

Ready

Hit her I dont get it

Are you talking about me

I meant to say Hi there Well it definitely says Hit her I'll try it again

Theres a new one

There

Hi there Hi there htler Goddammit

Hey Richard

You dont have any issue with us being an exclusively gay site do you

What

No

No its

Its totally cool

Oh

Wait a minute no I dont mean you are antigay

I mean the opposite

Like are you worried that were excluding straight people

Oh

I just remember you said you want your new Internet to be open for everybody and you know I just want to make sure were jibing with your vision

Deedee we are psyched to have you aboard

Exclude all the straight people you want

 You sure

 Yep

Because were not snobs about it

I mean between you and me Im dreadfully boring

I might as well be straight myself

Ive been with the same man for seven years

I go to church every Sunday

Look it

its all good

FirstSight is a gay dating site

And

and I will sing it from the rooftops

Alright well thank you Richard

I think this is gonna be great

Cool

Yeah

Okay

 Dont be weird

 I didnt know what wed be doing

So

everybody is very psyched

You know who else is psyched

I'll give you a hint

They have four thumbs and they are these two guys

 I am very excited

 I am giddy

Okay what

What happened

We found the mole

 What

 Yeah

Who

How

Good oldfashioned police work

I skimmed through all 40000 of the staffs outgoing emails

 Yeah

 And in addition to learning that we need to revise the office dating policy because it is essentially the Olympic Village out there I learned that someone has been sending a number of encrypted messages but using Gilfoyles purloined NSA tools

I cant hold this smile forever Jared

Get to the good stuff

One of our coders has been sending info straight to Hooli High Command

Wow

How the fuck did the mole get all this information

By exploiting our most glaring weakness

You were working as a waitress In a cocktail bar When I met Jeff Synced and corrected by louvette www

addic7ed

com No no no

You guys have it all wrong

Okay

Theres no way Jeff is the mole

Okay

Its not Jeff

Right Jeff

Jeff

What about Dave  Busters Jeff

What about that time I got a bullseye in SkeeBall and yelled out Bazinga And you said Okay You cant fake enthusiasm like that

Well I did

You Judas

You cowhanded poltroon

We

We thought you were a Stallion

Youre no Stallion

What is it with you guys and stallions

Whats with you being a rat fuck

You signed a very aggressive NonDisclosure Agreement

which you are in breach of

Which means we can fire you obviously and then have you arrested and thrown in jail

But Gavin would then know we are on to you so heres the deal

Youre gonna come into the office every day and sit down at your fucking workstation and pretend like nothings wrong

Fine

Uh that was mine

Bummer

The irony is the Internet which we all use to search for billions of things has itself long been searching for something

And here it is Okay then I turn and gesture

The Box Three

Signature Edition Then I come back to the podium

I put my name on this because I personally stand behind the new SASslash SSDslashNVMe drive bays the 24core processors

I stand behind the ECC DDR4 SDRAM LRDIMMs and their exceptional reliability

Will you stand with me About the spotlight should it be wider

 I had the same thought

 As did I

 I can speak with the technical team

 Please

Any word from our mole at Pied Piper

Im confident that if there were anything to report wed have heard about it by now sir

Alright

Im off to Jackson Hole for a couple of days to clear my mind and center myself

I'll be off the grid

Not to be disturbed for any reason

 Understood

 Absolutely

Is there anything else youd like us to take care of

Oh

Oh

The bear is sticky with honey

See ya soon

The bear is sticky with honey What does he mean by that

I dont know

Hello Stallions

You continue to be the best of the best

I commend you

And then theres you

The antiStallion

Move your hand off your fucking mouse now

And I was going to take you to see BattleBots live with me but no longer

friend Now who looks stupid

Yeah so um

our new developers just agreed to our terms and are now officially on board

Richard is a master at getting consent

Thats great news guys

Eight new partners

Yeah

Actually were calling them the OctoPipers

Uh until a better name comes along

Just wanted to give that one its day in court

Well we have some more good news for you Richard

You remember last year Laurie and I funded KHole Games

Largest independent gaming company in the Valley

Uh yeah of course

Um actually now that you

you bring them up II didnt want to be too forward but I was hoping that one day we could talk to them about joining our net

Well what if I told you that day is today

What

In addition to being business associates the CEO and I take medically prescribed and supervised MDMA together

Im taking it for severe postpartum depression

I do not know why he is taking it

Regardless when I saw him yesterday he was quite euphoric about speaking to you regarding a deal

KHole

The creators of the game Undead sex Offender

Theyre

theyre huge

Yeah

Yeah partnering with a company of that size this early would put us months ahead

This is not a done deal

KHole is protective of its brand

They will want to speak to you regarding who else you are dealing with

Okay right well um

why dont I just bring the OctoPipers

New name to come though its pretty popular around here

Uh they can talk to KHole

Tell them why they joined

Allowing you to speak less

Good strategy

Alright

KHole will be expecting you this afternoon

Knock em dead Richard

Whatever you are doing stop it now

Um yeah

Were just

highfiving

Bye

KHole

I cant believe it

Im bursting

Im bursting

Um here I printed driving directions

Oh its okay I got my phone

Well I have marked available bathrooms along the route

Okay here we go

Richard you never return my calls

You mean the hundreds of voicemails youve left where you just called me a terrible CEO with no dick

Yes

Youre talking to other companies

That is not public information

Im a part owner in Pied Piper

You need to make a deal with my companies

You mean your incubators spurious knockoffs of legitimate American businesses

New Expedia New Snapchat New Zillow

But theyre for Chinese market

Its a very sophisticated strategy

Okay look taking existing companies and just calling them new isnt sophisticated

Thats theft

You make a new Internet

That is different

I

Look were not gonna make any deals with any of your companies okay

Dont pick up

Richard hello

Its JianYang

You are a shitty CEO

As long as I own 10 of Pied Piper I will make chaos

Okay

I thought you hated that car

Aviato car smells like a dead pig

Youre aware that Russ Hanneman urinated in that car no

This car

Mmhmm

Uh

 are you just gonna leave it here

 Yes

Well

looks like I have a reason to find Pied Pipers official towing company

Im gonna get some bids

Yeah while youre at it see if you can find someone to bash that guys face in

Uh II can do some research

Maybe turn your phone off during the meeting

Youre a shitty CEO

Thanks again Colin for having us

Uh the fact that a company like yours with such a pristine reputation it sitting down with us is honestly incredibly flattering

Its cool

Ooh wow

 Thatll be a closed casket

 Yeah

Alright well we thought the best way to introduce the Pipernet would be through the eight developers that have already signed on

Who we are calling the OctoPipers

Thats dumb

Um anyway lets introduce you to the group

Um weve got a great analytics tool by a former Google guru

 Wish Id have thought of that one

 Cool

Uh music streaming with an AI taste predictor that is off the charts

Good space

Yes and this handsome devil over here is creating a very promising gay dating site

Thats cool

Yeah but dont worry hes not snobby about it

Hes actually pretty boring

I dont mean that as an insult

Those are his words

Longterm relationship

Doesnt smoke doesnt drink

And him and his man go to church every Sunday

So

loves Bible studies right

Just a straightup boring ordinary guy but obviously not straight

Very gay and also a Christian right

Okay so that went well

It started out a little weird but things really picked up

Why did you do that

 Why did you say that

 Say what

Richard you just told a room full of tech people that Im a Christian

Oh

Okay but

But you are arent you

Yes but I told you that in confidence

I said between you and me Im not openly Christian

Thanks a lot man

You just outed me

Oh Im sorry Deedee

I didnt

Okay um should we hug

I can not make it weird this time

Im

Im sorry Richard

You know that my default position is blind support of whatever you do but

this was not your best moment

Guys it cant be that big of a deal right

Why should it be

America loves Christians

Muslims are the enemy

Well thats true in most of America but not in Silicon Valley sadly

Sadly

You can be openly polyamorous

And people here will call you brave

You can put microdoses of LSD in your cereal and

and people will call you a pioneer

But the one thing you cannot be is a Christian

I find their theology to be illegitimate and its clear that they are the source of the majority of the worlds problems

But fuck Richard even I wouldnt just

out a Christian like that

Yeah it was kinda fucked up

Cool man thanks

Hey I thought he wasnt supposed to chime in

Yeah hes not but

based on its merits I'll allow that one

Guys come on

It cant be that bad

Richard

What the fuck did you do over there

So I just got off the phone with Colin over at KHole and while he loves your tech hes considering blowing up the deal

What

Just because one of my CEOs is Christian

It freaks people out in the Valley

Okay so what do you want me to do Monica

You want me to drop Deedee just because hes Christian

The companys not Christian

Its gay

which is fine right

Yeah

No that That plays great

Look cutting all ties to Deedee and FirstSight will definitely send a strong message to Colin

And it might be the only way

Like killing somebody to prove youre not a narc or showing a john your genitals to prove youre a legitimate male prostitute and not an undercover cop

 What

 Because cops arent allowed to do that

And worst case scenario the john walks off with a free peek

Oh thats the towing company

Excuse me

Forget it

Monica Im not doing it

I mean Im not dropping him

Alright

Fine

Fine

II will call Colin and try and smooth things over for you but you need to handle Deedee

Okay apologize for outing him of course but you need to make sure he keeps quiet about this

Alright cause its not just about losing KHole its way worse than that

Lets put it this way

Would you want to go from being a rock band to being

a Christian rock band

Oh shit

The bear is sticky with honey Those were his exact words

But what does that mean

Well Gavin speaks in parables

I think what Gavin is saying is

consider the bear And all this pizazz is like the honey

And its become too sticky

Theres too much of it

Its all over him

Incorrect

No see the whole launch is the bear and the honey is the pizazz

The bear needs more pizazz

The bear is ravenous for pizazz

You dont speak for Gavin

I dont need to

This is the word of Gavin

Alright forget it

 You do it your way I'll do it mine

 Okay fine

Gonna show you

Make it clear for all of you

Okay follow me

Well congratulations on becoming Pied Pipers official towing company

Uhhuh yeah great

So should I bill this to you or is Mr

Bighetti gonna take care of it

Bighetti

Its registered under his name




    push

Im sorry

Can I

Anyway it was a mistake

Im sorry I outed you

I just wish we could go back to normal

You know just like how things were

A CEO and a gay CEO

I dont even know what normal is anymore Richard

Its been such a crazy 24 hours you know

Gossip travels so fast in the Valley

I'll be lucky if my parents ever talk to me again

Your parents arent Christian

Im from Palo Alto

You know my dad says my lifestyle makes him sick

He just wants his gay son back

And hes okay with the gay part

 Hes gay

 Oh

But the crazy part is when I finally got home and I got in bed I had the soundest sleep Ive had in years

 Exhaustion

 No

Relief Richard

Im out okay

My nightmares over

I dont ever have to go back in the closet again and Ive got you to thank for it

Check it out

 Oh oh oh

You like it

Its good

I guess

maybe its just a little busy

Like um theres one word too many

One word

Well I like the gay part

If anything it could be more gay

You should gay it up and then I like the proud part

Its just the

Christian part

Look Richard this is great because now I can be gay and a Christian

Or just be gay

You know you could be a

a twink

A bear an otter

A circuit queen a chub a pup

A gipster a daddy chaser a leatherman a lady boy

You could be a Donald Duck which is a gay guy who got kicked out of the Navy

Yeah I

I know what it is

How do you know so many gay things

I worked with a guy

Just

dont be a Christian

Wow

After all you put me through it turns out youre biased too

No

No no no

Im not

I swear to you Im not

Im chill AF

Its just everybody else

Look if you go Christian I lose KHole games

I cannot let that happen

I know it sucks

Its shitty but its the truth

Im gonna make things easy for you Richard

Im out

 Of the closet

 No

The new Internet

The Internet you said was gonna be

What was it

The first truly free and open Internet Open for everyone

Whatever happened to that huh

Nice place

Oh thanks yeah

Oh wow

Thats a nice touch

Yeah thanks

The Monterey Bay Aquarium was testing their sonar and found this thing like two miles under the ocean

And I figure Erlich and I already bought it so I might as well hold onto it

Plus it weighs like 8000 pounds so I couldnt move it if I wanted to

Well and it also kinda works as your mascot

Right

Cause of your name

Oh yeah cause Nelson Oh I meant because its a big head

I guess that works too

So whats up man

Um well I wanted to ask you

Oh

Big Head

Now I get it

Sorry

Is

is it possible that the general partnership that you formed with Erlich is still in effect

Oh

No way

You definitely dissolved it

Yeah my dad insisted

I remember he filled out this whole form for me and made me sign it mail it in and everything

Yeah cause I

I remember I had the paperwork in one hand and the menu for Mr

Chows in the other

And then

Oh no way

Still have the paperwork

Guess I must have sent the menu

Big Head this is great news

Gavin

I think youre really going to love the changes that my team has made to the presentation

I think you might like ours even better

Sorry what changes

We are presenting two paths and you alone will decide which one we walk Gavin

What the fuck are you talking about

I thought the presentation was fine as it is

 Wait

What

 You did

Goddammit

Why is this still here

I said it was too sticky

Dont you listen to anything I say

 The bear

 Sticky with honey

So what did you change

Uh the spotlight

Yes

Were making it wider just like you asked

Good

You know what

Lets show you to your dressing room

Yeah

And whenever youre ready you let us know well show you that spotlight huh

 Youre gonna love it

 We did it

We had to fly him in from Tucson but we got the bear

Gavin hates the bear

You failed

Put everything back the way it was

And widen the spotlight

Guess what asshole

Leon told me he wanted your ticket cause he wants to go see BattleBots with me

But then he remembered he actually had plans that night with a bunch of people doesnt know what theyre doing their plans are sort of fluid plus its like friends from his old work so itd be weird if I hung out with them

Anyway

looks like you and I are going to see BattleBots

Youre going to hang out with me and have fun whether you like it or not

And what goes best with BattleBots

Thats right

Chicken wings

Thats why you get a sweet 50 gift card to Dave  Busters

Serves you right for fucking us over

Wash your fucking hair

And you know what happens when I get drunk Jeff

I get so sincere

Its really awkward

fuck you Jeff

Oh um can you drive

Well I spoke to La Flamme and its official

Big Head is still legally Erlichs next of kin

So JianYangs whole gambit was for naught

Wow really

Big Head owns Erlichs house and 10 of Pied Piper

I called the sheriff and started eviction proceedings

Were gonna get everything back

Oh also the uh OctoPipers are arriving for the meeting

Its a good thing that FirstSight dropped out right

Cause were back down to eight developers so you can keep that name

Actually uh no we cant

Wait what

 Im glad this worked out

 Yeah

Thanks for dropping FirstSight

Jesus my board would have nailed me to a cross

Well I think were just about ready to get going here uh

Oh

Hey

Oh good there he is

Whats he doing here

He is here because I asked him to be

I want him to be one of our developers

What

No

fuck that guy

Hey man hows it goin

 Richard

 Deedee

 Can I talk to you

 Yeah

No no no

Actually look

Look guys I

I asked you to be a part of this because I thought you were willing to take a chance on my idea

An entirely new Internet

An Internet that is everything the old Internet is supposed to be but isnt

Truly free and truly open

Well Im sorry gang

Truly open means open to everyone No matter how repugnant their views are

How ignorant or stupid or to be honest totally fucking wrong

And look who are we to judge right

Theres some people out there that believe that were living in a computer simulation

Well that is supported by the evidence

What

Uh its basic probability theory

Right uh Richard can I talk to you for just a sec

Yes of course

Uh thats bullshit actually

Its been disproven

But why does that even matter

In a few years well all be working for robots

No thats stupid

The robots will be working for us

Robots

Who gives a fuck about robots

Its the artificial super intelligence we should be worried about

Exactly and thats why we have to stop it

Stop it

No thats the us Im talking about

We have to bring it into existence

Otherwise it'll find out who didnt believe in it and punish them

 Right

 Guys I was wrong

Um Deedee is

not in

Hes actually very much out

So

doover on the whole speech

fuck that guy

Christians suck

And uh heres a good side effect though

Uh we all get to keep the name OctoPipers

You know what

Why dont we just take a quick five

And then well BRB and then go teams

So just

lets have a

What just happened

Deedees out

Yeah well he said that right after he bailed on us he went out and made a deal with our competitor

 But we dont have any competitors

 Richard

fuckin JianYang

Im gonna tear him a new asshole

It wasnt enough to do New Snapchat or New Expedia he had to do New Pied Piper too

Where did he get our code

He was always stealing snacks from the office

He couldve lifted it from anywhere

I guess thats what happened to my lavender cheese

JianYang

Open up

What the fuck

Why does every home Ive ever loved get stripped

Is that Erlich in the bucket

Uh

Richard

Hello I went to China to do new new Internet

Thank you

Enjoy your house

I love you

JianYang
