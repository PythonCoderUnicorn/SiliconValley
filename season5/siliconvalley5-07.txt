Richard

do you think if I asked they would let me visit her

RICHARD HENDRICKS Jared shes gonna be okay

I promise

DRILL WHIRRING

 HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING

 GAVIN BELSON That brilliant little idiot

He found a way around the patent

Its Hendricks internet but its not Hendricks internet

I will no longer be able to manufacture your boxes

You see my company will be manufacturing a new device that will quickly render yours obsolete

Did you speak to Laurie about our Series B

HENDRICKS Sort of

LAURIE RETCHING

MONICA HALL Nothing is personal with Laurie all right

Its what makes her such a great VC

A term sheet for your Series B

Congratulations Richard

Thank you

Richard Wow

That is one expensive bottle

You guys deserve the best bottle of champagne they have

Yeah all champagne tastes the same to me so

I agree I mean whats the difference between good champagne and bad champagne

About 500

Guys come on

Enjoy it

Youre about to close a 30 million series B

And you dont have to sell any ads or harvest user data which for any other VC in town wouldve been a nonstarter

Frankly Im surprised that Laurie went for it

Well Im not wild about the idea of her having two more board seats

I mean she did kll Fiona right in front of us

Listen dont worry about Laurie okay

Im gonna be your point person on this

Shes got her plate full

Shes raising money to recover from the whole Eklow debacle

Okay

So

to you guys

All right

Cheers

Cheers

Richard Yup thanks

All right

I have a dinner meeting and I kind of feel like a fifth wheel so Im gonna pick up the check leave you to celebrate

Congrats again guys

Okay

Jared Bye

Well the only person we dont spend 20 hours a day with just left

So

Whats new with you guys

Well Im thinking of buying some new bookkeeping software

All right

I think the only actual way to celebrate is to spend one waking minute apart so

Im gonna go

Are you going home

Lets lets share an Uber

Oh well if youre going that direction Im Im driving so I could drop you

Dinesh Hey Gilfoyle

Wanna play Fortnite

Oh hold on I didnt know we were playing Fortnite

Yeah I'll come along

theme music plays

  I wouldve taken that plate to the sink for you

Uh its okay

I just finished so

How was the sandwich I made you

Was it good

Good condiment blend

Yeah

It was perfect thanks

Richard

This might be out of line but

would you mind telling Jared how much you enjoyed the sandwich

Im finding him a little intimidating

Sure yeah

Look I know he can be a little eccentric

I tend to hold my breath around him

Its exacerbating my asthma

Ooh okay

Richard do you have a moment

You know what

Holden just made me a really good sandwich

Oh well thats nice

Yeah

Yep

clears throat

Did he ask you to mention that to me

What

No

Okay

No hes hes just great

Well In doing what we ought we deserve no praise because it is our duty St Augustine

So um

Ive been keeping track of the compute credits that you gave to Laurie

And she sold them to Gigglybots and then Gigglybots sold them to SmashHub

And they traded hands a few more times the price increasing each time until they were bought by a venture fund in Mountain View

Okay uh so if we wanted to buy them back how much would it cost us

Its 16 million

What

The fuck

More like that

Yeah

Danny So Dinesh is it true

Is series B happening

We all heard its happening

Oh guys please you know I cant talk to you about upper level management stuff

Its totally happening

Look at his face

He has the worst poker face

No

Dont dont look at my face

This is great news

Were all getting big fat bonuses

I was a little worried I made a mistake ordering that Tesla

Sorry Tesla

What Tesla

Model S

Same as yours

I mean not exactly the same

I ordered the P100D

Newer model

Its got longer battery life You know what

This is a workplace

This is not a fucking slumber party gabbing gabbing

And series B is not a done deal

Despite what my face says okay

Dont trust this face

No one should ever trust this face

Congrats on the Tesla Danny

So excited for you

Series B baby

fuck Danny

I mean I love my Tesla

It has Insane Mode which means it goes zero to 60 in 32 seconds which is literally insane

But the Tesla that Danny ordered has Ludicrous Mode which means it goes zero to 60 in 28 seconds

So its gonna take me an entire 04 seconds longer to get to 60

I mean how would you feel if one of your neighbors got a tiki head bigger than yours

Oh well when we bought it we made sure it was the biggest one they made so

Youre the biggest tiki head guy in the neighborhood

I used to be the Tesla guy in the office

I maxed out my credit cards to be able to afford that thing

And now that were getting series B any one of these bourgeois new money millennial fucks can just go out and buy one

I dont wanna sound selfish but sometimes I wish only I made money

You know

What are we talking about here

You want us to launch a cryptocurrency

I do

The fact that people are willing to pay many multiples more for our compute credits than theyre worth we have an opportunity here

Worth is relative Richard

What do you mean

Why do people covet the silly pieces of green cotton paper in their wallets

Its because we are all sheep

And weve mutually agreed to endow certain things with value

And right now for some reason the market values our credits more than we did

Gilfoyle were not gonna suddenly pivot and become a digital currency company

Im not proposing a pivot

Im proposing that we sell digital currency as a way to finance our new Internet company

You wanted an alternative to Laurie Bream

Well its right here in front of you

PiedPiperCoin

Okay look I

Im not gonna bet the entire future of my new Internet and everything Ive worked for on becoming the next Bitcoin

You really expect me to do that

There are very few things that I will defend with true passion medical marijuana the biblical Satan as a metaphor for rebellion against tyranny and mother fucking gddmn cryptocurrency

Mmm

I have a PowerPoint that Ive been wanting to show you for some time

Gavin Walk me through this

We cant make our boxes in China because Yao has threatened every manufacturer in the country

Thats right

We cant afford Bangladesh because the workers have unionized

Sadly correct

And we cant use our place in Laos because one person gets her scalp ripped off and suddenly everyones screaming regulations

Yes

You know you hear a lot of chatter about the growth of the global economy but no one wants to talk about the downside

Gavin there is one other manufacturing option we havent discussed yet which considering the current circumstances might be worth consideration

Im open to anything

America

fuck you

I feel the same way

But we were recently contacted by the mayor of Goldbriar North Carolina

They had a DVR manufacturing plant that closed

The retooling would be minimal

Scott Theyve got a skilled labor pool just sitting idle and they sound desperate

Really

How desperate

It was pitiful

Really

In 350 BCE Aristotle defined sound money as being durable transferable divisible scarce recognizable

Gilfoyle

and fungible

What

Can we skip ahead 2400 years

I mean I know what cryptocurrency is

Richard a lot of work went into this presentation

Okay

Fine

But youre missing out on a lot of wisdom here

Why dont you tell me what you know about Bitcoin as a jumpingoff point

Okay sure

Uh well Im pretty sure it was founded by a Japanese guy

Or guys or girls going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008

True identity still unknown

Okay look every day I read an article about how were in a Bitcoin bubble

And who is writing those articles

I dont wanna say the establishment

But is it possible that Warren Buffett called Bitcoin a pyramid scheme because he has 92 billion conventional dollars to protect

Lets say hes right

Lets say Bitcoin dies

So what

MySpace Friendster they both died

But they paved the way for other social media tripe like Facebook and Twitter to completely overrun the planet

Crypto is out there

And its not going away

It just feels sketchy

In the same way that a new Internet is sketchy Richard

Well What is crypto

If not decentralized anonymous secure and an existential threat to the powers that be

I would think that youd be allin on something like that

Yeah

But do you really think we can create a currency worth 30 million

Because thats what wed be giving up

Maybe

Probably even more

But even if its less we would still gain control autonomy board seats and shares and you wouldnt have to rely on a VC who once fired you from your own company

So there is a mode above Ludicrous Mode

Am I correct

Yes

Its called Plaid

And it comes standard on the new Tesla Roadster

How do I get into one of these babies

Simple

You put down a 50000 deposit today

Okay

And youll be behind the wheel as soon as they become available

And how quickly will that be Stephanie

Soon

Were thinking a few years which goes by fast

My daughter was a teenager in high school

Next thing I knew

Im gonna stop you right there

Your oily salesmanship is starting to really irritate me

Okay

I need to maintain my Tesla superiority and I need to do it now

Okay Im looking at a new set of wheels here

The 21inch Arachnids

Very nice

But theyre not for sale

You can only get them through our referral awards program

You refer three other customers to us they buy a vehicle and zoopzoop you get the wheels

So if I get more people to buy Teslas then I will have the wheels and no one else can get them

Not even Danny

Im sorry whos Danny

Hes the guy with the shitty wheels

Major Wilkins And now the CEO of Hooli Mr

Gavin Belson

cheers and applause

Thank you Mayor Wilkins

Thank you Goldbriar for this warm wonderful welcome

You know being in North Carolina always feels like a bit of a homecoming for me

I own a vacation property just off the coast in Bermuda

Technically it is my primary legal residence

Good people of Goldbriar for too long foreign interests have used unfair trade and labor practices to plunder American wealth and steal American jobs

But I dont blame them for that

No

I blame weak spineless American politicians

But if your mayor does his job your jobs will come back and soon you will proudly be building the Gavin Belson Signature Box Three

applause

But if for some reason he cant make my very reasonable proposal work you know who to blame

Im excited to get started

What about yall

cheers and applause

marching band plays

  dramatic sting

  sighs

Jared Hi Holden

Oh

dramatic sting

Jared

Hi

Hi

Can I ask you a question

Of course

Did you ask Richard to tell me that he liked the sandwich that you made for him

No

Is that the truth

Yes

Okay

Okay

Good job with that plate

Thanks

inhales deeply

Dinesh Now I can see the looks on your faces

I know what youre thinking

Why does Dinesh care so much if I buy a Tesla

I'll tell you why

Because Teslas are good for the world

Surprisingly pedestrian wheels but you get over that

So come on

Series B right

Chaching

I was gonna use that to pay off my student loans

Thats boring

And dont take this the wrong way but it seems like its very important for you to be the Tesla guy in the office

Like weirdly important

Im not weird youre weird

You guys are being so weird

Come on

Whats it gonna take to get you into a Tesla today

Here

Ive printed out hundreds of these

There you go

There you go pass these on

Dave

Dave

All right whats this interesting idea

Gilfoyle and I were talking

And this may seem a little out there at first but

Instead of funding our launch with a series B what about

an ICO

An initial coin offering

Its basically a

Are you a fucking moron

Maybe I dont need to be here for this

Sit the fuck down

Okay

Richard what are you doing

Just exploring our options

Why

You dont think I have your back

Look I get that youre giving up board seats and shares but look what youre getting in return

As if the 30 million you were getting wasnt good enough we provide you with marketing networking staffing

We help you negotiate partnerships and navigate regulations

All these things that are changing by the minute

Gilfoyle can you help with any of that

Id rather just listen if its all the same to you

Look if you do an ICO youre not only saying fuck you to us youre saying fuck you to all VCs

Jesus Richard

Why would you even think it would be okay to talk to me about this

Like would you ask your wife who you should cheat with

No

Well maybe

I dont know I

I guess I was just looking for advice from a friend

Oh are we friends Richard

Yes of course

Really

Have we spoken once in the past year about anything other than business

Yes

Wait

No

Whens my birthday

Come on

Do I live in a house or an apartment

Did you even know that I was married

You are

I was I

had it annulled after three months

Did he ask you who he should cheat with

Look you came for advice fine

Forget an ICO

Okay

Im sure Gilfoyle told you that he can handle all the technical stuff

But this is not just a math problem

Theyre my direct competition

Ive done my homework on this

So before you walk away from stability and gamble your entire company on crypto theres another friend of yours I think you should talk to

I was such a fucking pssy when Bitcoin broke Richard

If I had the balls Id have put every penny I had into that shit five years ago watched it go up up up up up and then pulled out right before it all came crashing down again

I mean Jesus why didnt I do that

fuck me

But then it occurred to me I own 36 fucking companies Richard

If I make them all ICO thats 36 bites at the apple

So I did it

You

you did 36 ICOs

Yup

Did they work

You know one of the things being in the three comma club has taught me Richard is its not always about money

Sometimes its about wisdom

And did I lose a B

Close to it

fuck

But I bet I gained two B in wisdom

So you lost it all

Ha ha Richard if I didnt love this crazy guy so much Id knock his fucking teeth out

Nah nah I didnt lose it all

I mean one of them got shut down by the SEC

On a few we got scammed

But some of them worked

One of them worked

One

One out of 36

Yeah

Listen all the coin I had from the ICO that worked was on a USB thumb drive

And my dumb fucking housekeeper threw out my jeans cause they were ripped

Even though I paid more for the ripped ones

And the thumb drive was in the pocket so

300 million in crypto is buried out here somewhere

But my boys will find it

If they wanna get paid right

And when they do that coin could cover all the losers

I mean its up 3000 in the last two weeks

If it keeps going like this over the next three four months we could be talking the four comma club

Thats a T not a B Richard

man whistling

Mr

Hanneman

Shit you found it

laughs

Jose

Yes

No

I said a thumb drive

In the

thats an actual thumb

Thats a human

Just fucking put that back

Again Richard

the math is sound

  Well Mayor I sure have enjoyed our time together

Let me know when you get this done

Uh Mr

Belson Im sorry but this list of demands is not remotely workable for a community of our size

A mayors job is never easy

But youll find a way if you care about your constituents

Mr

Belson I grew up in this town

Ive lived here my entire life

Id do anything to

Wait wait wait wait

Your entire life

Mmhmm

How old are you

Fortyseven

Thats a little weird isnt it

The point is Id do anything to help the people of this area

But giving you public money on this scale would decimate our budget

I could have the local high school renamed after you

Rosa Parks has never even been to Goldbriar

I dont want a fucking high school

I wanna manufacture boxes at an 80 profit margin

I dont understand

All my asshole friends keep getting NFL stadiums and corporate headquarters all fully paid for

And you cant make one fucking factory happen

I mean the only things I have left to cut are essential services

There you go

Do that

You could have a volunteer fire department

Because I cant afford a penny more than this

Man Everybody ready

blows pitch pipe

Two three

 Oh Carolina prowl off   Dodododo   Jump an prance oh Carolina   Prowl off jump an prance   Dodododo   Oh Carolina gal prowl off   Gal yuh fi jump an prance   Prowl off   Dodododo   Jump and prance  jet engines revving

 Carolina come bubble pon me   Oh watch how she groove  Dinesh So pretty sweet right

Woman Yeah its nice

Sorry we couldnt find a safe spot to try Insane Mode

It feels like your kidneys are gonna get like ripped right through the back of your body

Its like

Yeah I dont think Id wanna do that

Well you dont need to do it

But you wanna be able to tell people that you can do it

Right

Its like having a gn

So Charlie and Nadia have already said yes

Youll finally have something to talk to them about

Oh let me think about it

Fine

Okay just pull into the designated EV 28 seconds

Oh fuck

Danny already got his car

I'll pay your down payment and first three months

Do we have a deal

Wow really

Make it six months

Fine

Okay just go

Hide before Danny sees us in this shitty car

Go go go

Go




    push

Wow uh

  phone vibrating

Hello

Hey guess what

My boss just bought me a car

What

No

Ew

Ugh

Richard

Ron LaFlammes office just called

And the series B paperwork is ready for you to sign

Okay

Uh well then I guess I'll just go over there and sign it

Richard I know you were pinning your hopes on the ICO but I I think series B is the right call

Yeah no I I hope so

Were gonna get the money we need to launch and everyone out there is gonna get a great bonus

And then youre gonna have an army of happy and highly motivated workers

Richard Jared

Everything okay with Holden

You mean like mentally

I was wondering that too

No

No no

Just like

like with you and him

Just seems like youre being really hard on him

Do you like him

Yeah

I mean sure

Okay

Its okay if you like him

Thats all that matters right

Yeah

Okay

Well I'll see you when uh

I'll see you when you get back from LaFlammes

  dramatic sting

Laurie Every institutional investor to whom I reached out agreed to participate in our second fund

The capital issues we faced due to Eklows failure have been remedied

Laurie you are a badass

Ah yes

A compliment

Well I think the numbers in our new prospectus speak for themselves

Sorry youre projecting that 70 of Pied Pipers operating income is gonna come from ad sales but

Pied Pipers not gonna sell ads

Yes

I understand that is their current position

No Laurie when we offered them their series B I promised Richard that we would never make them harvest data or sell ads

However that language is not part of their term sheet

I am not saying that we will force their hand on this issue

But neither am I saying definitively that we will not

Okay but you and I we are partners right

Of course

Any decision we make we will certainly make together

Good

As long as thats clear

And again great job closing our funding

Ah yes

Huzzah

Onward

  Laurie did you have the big hairy question put back on my wall

Yes

I like it there

But I dont

And yet

All right

One more right there

And donezo

Series babam

Richard dont sign it

Look I cant protect you

At some point Lauries gonna fuck you over and make you sell ads

What

And I dont think theres anything I can do about it

Dont sign the deal

I just did

Its done

Jesus Christ

Lauries gonna sell ads

Isnt that what I told you

What the fuck am I supposed to do now

bang

God

You know I can just tear these up right

No I know

Good

Gavin I like it

But can we adjust the proportions

Make the logo bigger

And and make the flag bigger

And and make the box bigger too

It all just needs to be bigger

Okay

Bigger

Yeah

Sir

Ah Hoover

Hows the factory coming

We almost online

Not exactly sir

Its gone

What do you mean

Did that dipshit mayor renege on our deal

No he made every effort including having the factory repainted

Okay

So whats the problem

Well apparently the painters left some oily rags in a garbage can

Mmhmm

But because of cuts to the sanitation service the trash was not collected and the rags smoldered and caught fire

And because of cuts to the fire department the blaze spread

A number of concerned citizens volunteered to help fight the fire but because the water was cut off they could not

Okay so what happened

Well the vast majority of our expensive rare earth materials survived the fire

Well thats something

Until the flames abated when because of mass layoffs of police the locals that were there to fight the fire decided instead to loot the burnedout factory

The National Guard attempted to reach the factory to help stop this but

The roads

The roads sir yes

Okay

So we lost it all

Everything

Yes

Also the IRS called

Somehow they found out about Bermuda

  Look when you take it all into account turning down our series B and doing an ICO to fund your launch may actually give you the best odds

You said ICOs are su1c1de

Well Im a VC and some of that might have been selfpreservational

Okay

Well even if you were exaggerating youre still right

I mean Russ Hanneman had 36 chances to make an ICO work and he basically failed

I only have one

Look Gilfoyle can handle all the technical stuff

You just need to hire someone who can handle the business side

Like who

I dont know

Im sorry but I gotta Uber back to the office before Laurie realizes Im gone

No no wait

Who do I hire

Someone who understands securities right

Not necessarily

I mean your coin doesnt have to be a security

You could do a utility token instead since you provide an actual unit of compute

Although youd have to convince the SEC

Damn it

Surge pricing

Monica

You might not even need to bother with a moving average pricing strategy when you launch

But you will need to keep a close eye on statements from the federal government South Korea and China

So whoever you do hire should definitely know how to do all that

Okay six minutes

Monica

What

Its you

Youre the right person

No

No

No no no no no

Come on

Give me one good reason

I

love my job

You hate working for Laurie

With Laurie okay

We are both equal partners

Okay

Look Monica

I will do the ICO

But only if you do it with me

Come on

Wait whats happening

Canceling my Uber

So youre in

fuck it

Im in

laughs

fuck series B

PiedPiperCoin is totally gonna work

Yes

It is

It totally is

Dinesh So just to confirm in order for this coin to be worth what series B was worth to all of us it has to sell for how much

68

Dinesh I see

And seven cents is less than that

Yup

Whose idea was this again

I believe the initial idea was Gilfoyles

To be fair it was Monica who really pushed it over the goal line

Well Im gonna head down to the Tesla dealer and beg them to take my car back

Well thats something

And my two referrals fell through

And I had to return mine

So now the only Tesla in the office is Priyankas and Im paying for that

So thats cool

Richard adversity is a great teacher

Just like cigarette burns

phone ringing vibrating

Laurie hi

Laurie Monica

Congratulations on the ICO

scoffs

Yeah yeah

Not quite the numbers we were hoping for

Im sure youre happy about that

On the contrary

Monica you have certain values

And I see no reason you should not work with companies that share them

Similarly I should work with companies that share my values

So no hard feelings

No feelings at all Monica

We are friends and we should not let business get in the way of that

Speaking of I am stepping into a meeting

Right well Im surprised youre taking this so well I really appreciate it Laurie

Let us talk soon

speaking Chinese

speaks Chinese

Have you received my proposal

speaks Chinese
