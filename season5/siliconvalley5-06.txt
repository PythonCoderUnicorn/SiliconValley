I give you the product that will carry Hooli to complete market dominance

APPLAUSE CHEERING

MAN WHISPERS

It looks like a pen1s

Yes

Yes it does

So were giving a random company a bunch of free compute power in our network

BERTRAM GILFOYLE The AI company

I made her

I can do anything I want with her

Ugh

Gross

Can you please tell me what you are going to do about this Jian Yang situation

Yes

Nothing

I went to China to do new new internet

Jian Yang Richard This went up yesterday

A fake Pied Piper

This is JianYang not us

Richard he has a website

Okay

He doesnt have a product

Just post a cease and desist on your own website and move on

We need action

I wanna move up our launch so we can beat this asshole to market

We need money

So how quickly can we get a series B together

Richard a series B is not a done deal

And Lauries not gonna be able to weigh in on this until shes done sorting things out over at Eklow

Why is she still over there

We put 112 million of our dollars into a company whose creepy CEO just fled with its most valuable asset

Ariel and that robot could be anywhere

Ariel fucked us too remember

I just had my whole company on a threeday code sprint to repair all the holes and unfuck all the damage he did

Besides Laurie doesnt work at Eklow

She works here with you and me

True but also not true

Look Laurie has installed herself as Eklows interim CEO

What

Laurie Ariel encrypted all of his files

We cant open any of them

Ah understood

Keep trying please

I spoke with the bank

Were not gonna make payroll

Noted

Thank you for your diligence

People are pretty upset

Somebody shattered the toilet

Ah yes well well certainly have to get that repaired wont we

Good work you two

Hang in there

  Hey Laurie

I know youre busy being a CEO but we have to have a serious conversation about

Laurie retching

Laurie Richard

Yes

I have vomited into my shirt

theme music playing

Puking

Thats my move

Thank you for

finding me a

a change of clothing

Well fortunately youre the same size as the robot

Richard the position of CEO is

taxing

It isnt easy is it

I think perhaps I may have treated you unfairly in the past

Oh

scoffs

Well

I mean a couple a couple yeah

Sure

Thank you

Thank you for saying that yeah

Yes

Well I have work to do as do you so

scoffs

  indistinct chattering

You know Laurie I actually may have a way to help you here

Yao Things are changing in China now Gavin

There are many reforms

As you see we provide a series of Tai Chi and movement classes free for all employees as well as free medical benefits

Ah our nutrition center

In addition to all the good food we serve in our main cafeteria

Also free of charge

This concludes our tour

Any questions

Just one

What the fuck

Sorry

If I wanted to see nap pods and climbing walls I wouldve stayed home or gone to fucking Denmark

All I wanna see is people working as hard as they possibly can

Thats why we come to China

This is the new China

We found that the more humane work environment we have the more sustainable over time

Over time

No no

The Box Three has a very limited window of profitability

I need you focused on making as many of them as possible as fast as possible

Gavin

You know our shameful history of worker suicides

Since the renovation not a single one

Gavin Not even one

Okay

But theres gotta be like a middle ground here

woman speaks Chinese

Ah a happy surprise

The children from our daycare center have prepared a traditional song just for you

singing in Chinese

Thats wonderful

Yao I need you to give me 30 more output

I dont care how you do it

Just a thought those kids dont look that busy

singing continues

typing

Are you done with

your chunk yet

Almost done

Because everyone else is done

Literally everyone

snoring

47 engineers finished

One not

You

Almost there

Im sure it'll be worth the wait

slurps

Mmm no thats way too strong for him

Hey guys

Hows the code sprint going

Tminus Dinesh

Jared Richard I am pleased to say that your new assistant is a quick study

And per your text he posted a wellcrafted cease and desist directed at JianYang on the Pied Piper website

I made some judicious edits to capture your voice but the thrust of the piece was his

I have a law degree so

Well done Holden

Is that tea for me

It is indeed

Okay

Great

No no no no dont

Its too strong

Okay

Water it down

So did you speak to Laurie about our series B

Sort of

Uh Gilfoyle is there a secure way of giving someone access to our servers while still limiting and controlling how much compute they could use

I could create a credit system

Wait Im sorry Richard

Who would these credits be for

Laurie Bream

She made herself CEO of Eklow

Im just trying to help her out

Pardon

Do you think you could set those up by today

More work

Fantastic

Richard I dont quite understand

Dinesh Done

Done

I am done

Dinesh laughing

Look at this

Whoo

Code sprint over

gong rings

applause

gong quiets

Uh congratulations everybody

Really good good job

Um the only thing left to do now is

get back to work and review all the code for errors

Okay so

groaning

Okay

That was an outofbody experience

It was like God was coding through me

Time stood still

Not for the rest of us it didnt

Laugh it up Gilf

I hear you making your little jokes at my expense turning all the engineers against me

But the second these results go up theyre all going to see the only thing that matters Who made less errors

You mean who made fewer errors

Oh you think youre so clever

You know who else thought it was clever

The hare

Right before it was defeated by the tortoise

Im the fucking tortoise Gilfoyle

Im the fucking tortoise

Keep saying that

I cant wait for these results to go up

Guys

No no no

We talked about this

Remember

Youre both senior management now

Okay

Your code will be subject to private review

No

No no no not private

Everyone has to know that Im better than Gilfoyle

Im sorry

When it was just us a little cocksmanship was a fun diversion

But the entire engineering teams morale depends on seeing you both as equally competent leaders

Danny over there is going to be reviewing your code and keeping the results completely confidential

Jared

I believe we all know whos the better coder anyway

Um Richard

Im sorry Im still having a little bit of a hard time understanding

You went to see Laurie to get money from her but now youre giving our resources to her

Why would you do that

Well honestly Jared she was a mess

And I really genuinely felt bad for her

For Laurie

Yup

Richard you have an enormous heart

And I dont mean in the same way my deceased friend Gloria did which the doctors should have really caught because her knuckles were gargantuan

But do you think in this instance you might have allowed your emotions to cloud your business instincts

Well I would argue that I made a very good business decision

Because now Laurie is on our side

Which will play out very nicely when we negotiate our series B

Okay Richard it is important to develop emotional selfdiscipline for situations like this

Mmhmm

Sometimes you have to numb yourself

If you wanna work the corner you cant fall in love every time you turn a trick

Thats why you do the oxy

What Im saying is if you ever need to develop strategies to cultivate more emotional selfcontrol obviously I do have some experience

You do

Doubtless youve noticed that Ive been pulling away from you

Uh no no I cant

honestly say that I have

Look at Holden out there

You think I didnt love making your tea

Who wouldnt

But when you anointed me COO I learned to stop investing those feelings in you for the good of the company

Call it emotional abstinence

Jared look um in regards to the whole Laurie thing I actually think I made the right call

Alright

Alright

Well I am available

Not emotionally obviously

Got it

street noise

Ooh theres a highly rated new dim sum establishment in this neighborhood

Sir Richard Hendricks just posted a cease and desist letter

unlawful copying of Pied Pipers proprietary software Are you fucking kidding me

That idiot let someone steal his code so now there might be two companies working to make my box obsolete

I'll try to find out whos responsible

Good luck

HooliMaps says dim sum is that way

Right turn please

tires screech

both yelling in Chinese

Gavin Look

Pied Piper

Follow that Chinese man

The Chinese man on the bicycle

The Chinese man on the bicycle in the green Pied Piper tshirt

Ah

Gavin Hurry hurry

Come on

Dont lose him

clicking tongue

Hey dude hows it goin

Hows that

review going

Probably done right

Cause it took you no time counting up the bugs in my stuff

Cause I crushed it so hard

Compared to Gilfoyle

Right

I get it

I get it

Its a secret

Company morale

Im so on board

I did crush him right

He did better than me

Oh my God

This is my worst fucking nightmare

But not by a lot right

He didnt like kick my ass

He kicked my ass

That fucker

Just fucking tell me

Just fucking tell me how much he kicked my ass by

Please just fucking tell me

Im not gonna beg

Im not gonna beg

Please

Please

Please

Please

Please

Please

Just please tell me please

Okay fine

You just have to swear not to tell anyone okay

I swear I wont tell anyone

Everyone everyone

I have a very important announcement to make

My code was better than Gilfoyles

So its official

Gilfoyle is a much worse coder than me

I want you all to look at him

Good

Terrible

Role model

Hateful pile of trash

Bullshit

Says who

Danny told me

He wasnt supposed to

Supposed to be a secret but he told me and now everyones laughing at you

Dinesh laughing mockingly

Everyones laugh

Danny

What the fuck is going on

Did his code actually have less errors than mine

I dont know what to tell you

I checked it three times

And its fewer errors

Ooh

This is the best day of my life

Congratulations

Thank you

I feel bad for gloating

In all seriousness that means a lot to me

To show you Im a gracious winner I'll take you to a nice restaurant

Your favorite kind of restaurant

A missteak house

Boom

Get it

Cause you suck

laughing

sighs

door closes

knocking

Yes

Ni hao

Do you know who I am

No

Okay okay

Well Im the one who accidentally struck one of your employees with my car earlier and its a personal habit of mine to make things right

So

Do you mind if I come in

  Okay what else

Uh Colin from KHole Games called checking in on the restore

Put him on the phone sheet

Next

Uh Laurie Bream said that she received the compute credits and to say thank you

You see

Business and compassion are not mutually exclusive

In fact sometimes going out of your way to help a fellow colleague can actually put you further ahead in business

Let that be a lesson to you young Holden

Im 30

And uh the CEO of a company called the Gigglybots called

He wants to know how to redeem the compute credits he just bought from Laurie Bream

What

Ariel was apprehended this morning shoplifting machine oil from an auto parts store in Turlock

There was however no sign of Fiona

And with her missing I have no need for compute power therefore no need for your compute credits

Selling them I think youll certainly agree was merely a practical business decision

Okay but I gave you those credits as a gift

I was helping you

You were vomiting remember

Ah yes

Admittedly a moment of weakness

However immediately after your departure I consumed two egg whites and a green bean and regained my composure

Laurie when someone gives you a gift and you dont want it you give it back

Okay

You dont just go sell that gift to the next fucking highest bidder Richard mind your tone

Your lack of emotional discipline is troubling

You need to work on this

Or I may have serious doubts about granting you your series B

chatting in Chinese

Gavin A lot of computers in here

I dabble a bit in tech myself

All these people working here

You must have something coming to market soon

No

We have trouble with the government

Ive heard that

I mean to even operate an online platform inside the Peoples Republic of China you need a governmentissued ICP license right

I left a good life

Free rent

Great friends

To fail in China

We try to rewrite code but government still wont give us license

Maybe well quit

Try something else

Do you like octopus

Gavin I do

Is that what youre working on

Thats a decentralized network huh

Wait what did you do there

Looks like you removed the data federation servers

Yes

And added multicasting and data projections

Why

That wouldnt work

It works

Works fine

JianYang Government still does not like it

Best of luck

Thanks for the tour

Ah Gavin

Dim sum closes in 40 minutes

Holy shit

Holy fucking shit

That brilliant little idiot

He found a way around the patent

Sir

Its Hendricks Internet but its not Hendricks Internet

I want to share in your excitement sir but I really dont follow

That guy in there he took Hendricks software and changed it

So much so that it shouldnt work

But it does

He showed me the demo

And heres the thing its different enough that Hendricks patent wont cover it

Are you sure

Of course Im fucking sure

I wrote that patent Hoover

Ive got a hundred engineers back at Hooli trying to get around it

They failed

But somehow that monosyllabic moron just stumbled into it

I need that kids code

I hope that book youre reading is for work

Oh absolutely

But if you wanna read for fun you should read Gilfoyles favorite author George Error Martin

Hear that

Were all making jokes at your expense

Is that whats happening

As your supervisor I wanted to inform you that there is a first aid kit but if you need blood dont go to Gilfoyle cause hes typeO

Typo

laughs

They love it

Theyre all laughing at you

Pixars hit animated motion picture Toy Story Pixars hit animated motion picture Toy Story elevator dings

Pixars

oh hey

Were you guys talking about Pixars hit animated motion picture Toy Story

No

Cause Gilfoyles favorite character is Bugs Lightyear

laughing

Were all laughing at you Gilfoyle

Monica on phone Are you still at Eklow

Uh no

Im back at the office

You know Jared was right

I showed compassion to someone who deserves none

Nothing is personal with Laurie

Alright

Its what makes her such a great VC

And in all candor a very challenging business partner

I gotta be honest its really nice not having her in the office

Yeah well now I have to buy my own compute credits back with money I dont have

Its that one

which was the whole point of getting series B

Im telling you unless you have money you cant get honks horn

Excuse me

Richard

Hello

Im gonna have to call you back

Richard

What the Pied Piper right

Uh yeah

What is she doing here

How did she Credit card works I dont ask questions

Well this is fucking weird

Ive seen weirder

Driver So should I just

leave it on the sidewalk or what

50000 for the whole thing

All you have to do is give me your hard drive with the code base on it

Oh and the underlying rights to the code in perpetuity throughout the universe

Sign there

No

Okay

I like the way you negotiate

100000

Final offer

Take it or leave it

speaking Chinese

laughter

He said If oil company wants to buy your house there is oil underneath But Im not an oil company




    push

No you are Gavin Belson

Oh so you do know who I am

Im smart

Just name your price

Im not going to sell you my code until I know why you want it

Goodbye

Hello

Whoa

This is so cool

So uh

apparently Ariel and I were the only people that talked to her and hes in jail

So

she came looking for me at Pied Piper

And you brought her here

Can we keep it

No

No we cannot

Richard shes stolen property

And shes worth a fortune

We we have to take her back to Laurie

Fiona whats 12 times 157

Twelve times 157 is 1884

gasps

So cool

Hey is she right

phone chimes

Hey Siri whats 12 times 157

Siri Its 1884

Oh no way

Richard No no no

Look

You were right

I was lacking in emotional discipline

And Im not gonna let that happen again

From now on Im leaving my emotions off the fucking table baby

Okay but Lauries gonna get her robot back

Tomorrow

After she gives us something in return

A signed series B term sheet

Laurie Bream please

Oh you bet your fucking ass I'll hold

Gavin Im not asking you to cut off his testicles and shove em down his throat shoot him in the back of the head Triad style

I just need you to get this kids code for me

By whatever means necessary

That is to say through extortion or threats

Well

Gavin

As I told you this is new China

Things have changed

Youre telling me you run a factory this big and you have no connections to the Party

No way to help this kid see the light

Come on

Look Yao either you convince this kid to sell his code to me or Im pulling my box contract and Im taking it somewhere else

There are plenty of other countries in this part of the world with cheap labor pools

Theres no new Bangladesh

Theres just Bangladesh

sighs

I'll see what I can do

Excellent

Jared I told Laurie that wed get Fiona back to Eklow around 900

So when you get here just pull up to the garage and well

Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit

Shes gone

She escaped

How the fuck did she

What

Wait where

Jared Its kind of hard to explain but

a campfire smells sad and exciting at the same time

Fiona I understand

Yeah

laughs

Hey

Hey

What are you doing out here

Oh uh well

a few hours into our conversation Fiona mentioned shed never seen the ocean

So I thought about driving her there but then I realized since it was dark she wouldnt really appreciate its majesty so I brought her out here to the pool

So youve just been out here all night talking

to a robot

Fiona would you excuse us for a second

Yes

Come on

Come here

Okay

I know that Fiona is a manmade piece of digital equipment Okay

powered by artificial intelligence

Good

But the level of that intelligence is its gobsmacking

I mean I dont remember ever having a conversation like the one Ive been having with her over the last 12 hours

Twelve hours

We have so much in common

We discussed our phobias

I told her that I was afraid of being found out as a fraud

And she told me that shes afraid of magnets

Look Richard we felt a connection

Its funny

The past few weeks Ive been feeling irritable and shorttempered and here I am on no sleep at all and I just feel

woohoohoo

You know

Hey Jared

Yes sir

You know how youve been practicing your words emotional abstinence on me

Yeahhuh

Yuhhuh

Okay

Well do you think that its maybe at all possible that because of this youve got some pentup emotional energy and last night you had the chance to release some of that pentup emotional energy onto the robot

Her name is Fiona

Alright well Im shutting her down and returning her

Wait wait wait

Okay

What if we didnt give her back

What if we called Laurie

We could negotiate some kind of a deal

Jared whatever happened to emotional discipline right

Feelings and business

Its over man

Okay

Its over

sighs heavily

Okay stop looking at me please

Just look look up there

whirring

Its daytime but I can see the moon

  Okay do you want to do you want to ride with us while we take her back to Eklow

Oh yes

Playground games

Gilfoyle likes to play Suck Suck Goose Oh

Or it could be Duck Duck Goofs Danny

Do those qualify as two separate insults

Uh yeah

I believe they do

gong rings

Why did he gong

Because I told the engineers that if you thought you had won which you definitely have not it would take you less than 24 hours to cobble together 200 uniquely terrible insults

Which you have just done

That is why I had Danny tell you you won

Is that true Danny

Did Gilfoyle really

beat me

Private audit

Cant say

So we dont know who actually won

The code contest no

But while you were running around racking your tiny brain for shitty insults I was quietly plodding towards this victory

You see

it is I who am the tortoise

And you are the hairy Arab who can now chortle my balls

gong rings

applause

Whats happening

Why did you do that

Right after you forced me to set Dinesh up I told the other engineers that if you won youd immediately insult Dinesh by saying something sexually demeaning or racist

And you just did both

I see

Fun at my expense

Now if its alright with upper management we have a shit ton of work to do

Yeah like so frickin much

Assholes

I wanna fire Danny

Do it

I'll ask Richard

We are at Eklow Labs

Yes we are

The site of my creation

Richard

Do you think if I asked they would let me visit her

Jared shes gonna be okay

Alright

Shes gonna be plugged back into her old servers surrounded by familiar engineers sitting on the table where she was born

I promise

Shes going to be fine

drilling

Extreme care with the optical sensors gentlemen

Boston Dynamics needs them overnighted

Richard I dont understand

Fiona is this companys most valuable asset

Yes and as such she will garner the highest return when I have her dismantled and sold off for parts

So youre just gonna take all this promising tech and liquidate it

Yes

As quickly as Im able

Dude check it out

blubbering

Im a robot

laughs

Richard being a CEO is a terrible waste of time

And a horrible way to make a living

drilling continues

I'll be returning to BreamHall immediately

objects clattering

Speaking of

as promised

A term sheet for your series B

Congratulations Richard

Thank you

See

Silver lining

chuckles

I told you Wait uh

Hey Jared

Dont Dont go over there

Dont look in that

Jared Oh Fiona

Come on lets

moans

Lets get out of here huh

What do you say we go to the office and you can make me some tea

That might make you feel better

So did he sign

door closes

Its done

fuck yes

Howd you get him to do it

I made it clear it would be better for him to hand over the company and leave town immediately

Thats some old Chinese shit right there

I told you youre a badass Yao

Wait this lists you as the buyer not me

So whats the plan here

Youre gonna sign it over to me then

Gavin Im afraid I will no longer be able to manufacture your boxes

You see my company will be too busy manufacturing a new device built on a radically better technology that I now own that will quickly render yours obsolete

Here in China and according to the US

patent office in America as well

woman speaking in Chinese

Oh the children have returned to sing for you

singing in Chinese

speaks Chinese

 My chains new gold watch made in China   We play ping pong ball made in China   The bitch mother says pay made in China   Yeah Higher Brothers black car made in China   She said that she didnt love me   She said that she didnt love me   She said that she didnt love me   She lied she lied   She all made in China   She all made in China   She all made in China   She lied she lied  singing in Chinese

continues singing in Chinese

continues singing in Chinese

 She lied she lied  DINESH CHUGTAI I need to maintain my Tesla superiority

Any one of these millennials can buy one

How would you feel if your neighbors got a Tiki head bigger than yours

 HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING

 JARED DUNN Ive been keeping track of the credits that you gave to Laurie

If we buy them back how much would it cost

Onepointsixmillion dollars

What

BERTRAM GILFOYLE You want an alternative to Laurie Bream

Well its Pied Piper coin

MONICA HALL Before you walk away theres a friend you should talk to

You did 36 ICOs

Did they work

Yup

Its not always about money

Sometimes its about wisdom

So you lost it all

LAUGHS

Richard

If I didnt love this crazy guy so much Id knock his teeth out

 MUSIC CONTINUES
