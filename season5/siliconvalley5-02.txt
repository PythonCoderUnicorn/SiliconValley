I sent you 63 good people

You have to choose

They have to meet our rigorous standards

I mean look at the three weve already hired

Stallions

Hooli is the future and your future is

The Box 2

Are there any questions

Everything youre doing here is antiquated

fuck you guys

Get out of here

You wish to acquire a company called Sliceline

I will be taking on a total engineering team of about 50

Um

Wha

Dont tell anyone okay

Um

My Tesla finally came

Was that a wise purchase

Considering Richard just obliterated Pied Pipers runway hiring all those coders

I ordered it a month ago

But still its an investment

As I understand cars depreciate 10 percent as soon as they fall off the truck

Like that

So if the car costs 100 well you just lost 10

Did it cost 100

Or more

Its not about the money

I my friend am now part of the green revolution

Are you

Most electricity still comes from gas plants and coalburning smoke stacks

Do you know where your electricity comes from

 No

 Mmhmm

Look how shiny it is

Plus it has a frunk

A front trunk

Here hop in let me give you a ride to work

Dinesh you like this

Jesus fucking Christ

 Is that a dead pig

 Yes

Its just like Errich

My corrupt uncle sent a death certificate from China but to send body is too expensive

So

I cremate a pig because a pig is most like a fat human

I gotta get to work

Dinesh

can you take pig to backyard

I need to burn it

No

Thats odd

You left before me

How was I able to park before you

I guess all 50 of the new employees decided to show up bright and early for the fucking allhands meeting

I had to park on level five

Huh

So unlike you the world understands that Im saving the planet and has rewarded me with

primo spot

Congratulations

Youve finally taken your rightful spot amongst the handicapped

SILICON VALLEY Season 05 Episode 02 Episode Title  Reorientation Is it broken

Uh no

I think Im okay

One question what the fuck happened

Cause

you were doing your speech right there in front of the whole company and then

Wow

Well

uh my speech was going poorly

 Agreed

 Yeah

And I started to panic

With good reason

And then

all of a sudden I

I thought I had to shit my pants okay

And thats why you jumped face first into a glass wall

No it all happened so fast but

essentially I thought if it was gonna happen I didnt want to be standing

So I crouched because

If you wanna shit yourself youd rather be crouching than standing

Yes

I mean if you had to

I hate to say this but I follow you

The thing is when I crouched I had to burp

But since I was all you know tucked up I actually vomited a little

And then thats when my fightorflight reflex kicked in

Do you ever fight

Okay fine then my or flight reflex kicked in and I just

Pow

Yeah

Okay

Well what we saw was a very oily man in midsentence dip down vomit and then thrust himself violently face first into a glass wall

But I guess its a lot less embarrassing the way you explain it

Richard what about

Did you evacuate in your pants

Oh no uh good news

I think what happened when I hit the glass I sort of shocked myself

Now I dont have to

Thats actually kind of disappointing because like no closure

Well on the bright side it'll be that much easier to get you cleaned up and back out there

What

I have you scheduled for three more days of orientation

No way

Cancel them

Theres no way Im going back out there

Especially after knowing what they saw

No fuck it

Plus Im

Im way too busy so

Gentlemen could we have the room please

So we can leave

Sweet

Richard look out there

Theres Optimoji and Sliceline tshirts left and right

These are conquered soldiers still in their old uniforms

But we need everyone here to be Pied Pipers

I mean youre asking them to spend the primes of their lives on your vision

Right

And you need to go out there and lead them

Theyre

theyre yearning for inspiration

I cant do inspiration

Im a coder

Look there the new Internet

Thats inspiration

Use that

Richard this is all an idea

And people dont wanna follow an idea they wanna follow a leader

Look at the last guy to create a new Internet

Al Gore

His ideas were excellent but he talked like a narcoleptic plantation owner so he lost the presidency to a fake cowboy and now he makes apocalypse prn

Look the point is you need to lead with passion

When you set your mind to it youre one of the most charismatic people Ive ever met

And I have met Ira Glass

I know its three days we could be working but ultimately a unified team will save us time in the end

You wanna save time

If you wanna save time heres what you do

You said it yourself okay the Optimoji guys and the Sliceline guys are separate with their own separate histories their own separate shorthands so lets use that

Lets give the scheduler to the Optimoji guys and the serverless runtime to the Sliceline guys

Then we have Dinesh and Gilfoyle and the Stallions they do the integration

Boom were off and running

How about that

That way no one has to shit or burp or puke or get a nosebleed in front of anyone

As for the bezel design our young aesthete Dang has once again spun gold

Lets see it

Wait my signatures not on it

How could it be the Gavin Belson Signature Box III without Gavin Belsons signature on it

Well the word signature has a handwritten feel to it

Why is my signature not on this

Gavin there was a slight issue with your signature

What issue

Do you have a mock Pull it up

Ah yes

There

Whats wrong with that

Well reactions to this from our testing groups were mixed so we contacted a handwriting expert

And uh well

Jean do you have the report

Absolutely

Pleasure to be on your team Gavin

Here it is

The signature displayed troubling traits

Left of upright slant narrow angles tense strokes conclusively indicative of sociopathic tendencies  What

 Characterized by a lack of empathy and need to dominate a willingness to hurt others to achieve ones goals

Inability to accept bad news  Hoover

 Sir

Get this horrible women the fuck out of my office now

What the fuck is that

Its the cheapest thing I could find that qualified as an electric vehicle

I found it on Craigslist

Now you get to park on the fifth floor

Enjoy the drive

Oh and you were right

it does feel good to be a part of the green revolution

Oh yeah

Well does that vehicle have Insane Mode

One press of a button and I go zero to 60 in 32

What a day

See wed still be finishing up orientation singing Kumbayas and doing trust falls

But instead both our Optimoji and Sliceline teams have gone through their first code review

Well to be fair I never wouldve scheduled trust falls

I mean you do one of those youre so jacked up on adrenaline the rest of the day is basically shot

We were gonna have a noncompetitive talent show with no losers

Not possible

dick I just got in and checked the commits

Are you aware that the Sliceline guys have been encoding time in nanoseconds as we usually do but the Optimoji guys have been using milliseconds

What

Just the fact that were still calling them Sliceline guys and Optimoji guys is sending up all sorts of red flags

And I dont even mean the word guys which I just learned is a microaggression

Its fine guys I will get them to refactor their code

Were still ahead of where wed be if we were doing some kind of talent show

Richard

Gilfoyle parked his electric pile of trash in my Teslas spot

Do you think thats fair

Not now Dinesh

Why cant you guys switch to milliseconds

Why do we have to change

Sorry well our entire code base uses nanoseconds

And you didnt think it was important to tell us this

No well I mean it was

It was part of the orientation that was scheduled which had to be for numerous reasons uh canceled

And Im sorry about that I know it sucks

If I could make it suck less I would but

You could get some decent coffee in here

What

Whats wrong with

Philz Coffee

Thats highend joe bro

At Optimoji we had Stumptown brought in every day

So that would inspire you

Different coffee

Inspire us

You know what

Bup bup bup

Stumptown it is

You got it

And youll tell your guys about the nanoseconds

Yeah

Unless you wanna get up in front of everyone and announce it yourself

No no no Id rather you

That was a joke

Your speech was a disaster

Oh

Yeah

You know

Yeah

It was really bad

I know

Okay Mr

Jian you have petitioned this court to become the sole executor of the estate of Erlich Bachman is that correct

Yes

I see youve got all the paperwork here

Yes

Errich Bachman is dead

Oh

Um

Mr

Jian theres absolutely no need to display the deceased remains

You can put that away

 I have it

 Yes

Please put it down

Errich Bachman is cremated

into ashes

And I put it in bucket

Put it down sir

Now have you determined to a reasonable degree of certainty that Mr

Bachman has no living next of kin

No wife children parents no brothers sisters nieces nephews grandparents children from a predeceased spouse or domestic partnership

No

He died alone

Hes a very sad man

So I have a

a house and a 10 Pied Piper

In the absence of any next of kin I will approve you as the sole beneficiary and the official executor of Mr

Bachmans estate

But before you can distribute any of his assets into your personal possession you are required to settle all claims against the estate

Do you understand

So I get a house and a 10 Pied Piper

You need to pay all of his outstanding bills

How much do I have to pay

Well these debts can sometimes be substantial

Would you characterize Mr

Bachman as a financially responsible man

Hey Sliceline guys whats up

Heh

So

Um wanted to talk to you guys about something

Past couple days the Optimoji guys have really stepped up their game but um you guys

have kind of been flagging

Im just wondering if everythings all right

Yeah

Great

Just nice to know where we stand

Sorry

We get it

You only acquired Sliceline because you wanted Optimoji

What No wrong

Uh why would you say that

I didnt

You did when you chose their coffee over ours

Its bad enough we cant have Slice here

Slice

The beverage

No no

Slice was our mascot

Hes really smart

Okay well

Bring the little guy in

What about the no dog policy

What no dog policy huh

Really

Are you sure you dont need to check with Optimoji

Im pretty sure but uh

Danny  What

 Uh I just was wondering if youre cool if the Sliceline guys  brought in their dog

 Hes really smart

Well at Optimoji we had a no dog policy

Come on

Dont be such a dork

Let em have it

Its just a dog

Sure

Fine

Youre the CEO

Yes I am

All right

And from this point on CEO stands for Canine Endorsement

Oh

yeah

All right

Hey look at you and your 10speed

Aw you got up early cause you thought you could take my space

Thats cute

Almost as cute as your bike

Yeah I guess this is a bike isnt it

So I get to use the bike lane

See you later

No bikes still have to follow traffic laws

Thats not fair

All right

You wanna get insane

Lets get insane

Whoa

fuck you Gilfoyle

Somethings wrong with your frunk

Its all frucked up

Hey Tesla

You know where Pied Piper is

Right here guys

What the fuck

dick

Hey uh

Explain

Okay uh

So Optimoji had a no dog policy and apparently thats because every single one of em have a fucking dog

And when we waived our no dog policy

You waived our no dog policy

I had Jared put that in there for a reason Richard

In Pakistan dogs are not pets okay

Theyre vicious beasts and they chase you down the street and they bite you

My cousin Eftahar lost an ear

Our mayor was very corrupt

But he put poison pills in chicken meat to take care of the dog problem

We hailed him as a hero

We put up statues of him everywhere

Hes gonna be okay

Whos gonna be okay

 What

 Stallion down

Hes violently allergic to dogs

Its another reason for our ironclad no dog policy

Jared when were you planning on telling me all of this

Day two of orientation

Right after safe space charades

So look well pay for your entire medical bill obviously

So youre good

Youre covering his deductible

Then you have to cover ours right

And what about the dogs

Theyre people too

Theyre literally not

Theyre dogs

Hold strong

fuck you

Oh

So

Jared uh you wanted me to unite the teams and I have

They are united against me

Even the dogs apparently

I wish they had your fecal fortitude

Hey do me a favor and

just take care of all the dogs

And then call an allhands

Ive clearly gotta say words

Ooh okay

Really didnt wanna be back up here again

And I think we all remember why you know

But you probably dont know this but I almost sh

They dont need to

Farted

Yeah

Which would be embarrassing

Anyway look uh

I know I

should be the inspiration for you guys but to be honest thats not really who I am

And if this company lives or dies by all the flowery things I say well then to be honest were fucked

Ha

They say that

people dont follow ideas

But I think in this case you guys should

Because

the idea of creating a new Internet thats special

Right

And weve been given the opportunity to rewrite

the most important thing in human history

And we can build it the way it shouldve been made all along

You know not this shitty addictive parasite that companies like Hooli use to spy on us and exploit us

Okay

There

Thats your inspiration

Not me

Not coffee

Not dogs

So

if Im not inspirational enough for you and if you dont wanna be here well then theres the door

And well give you enough severance to cover you to your next job

But if you wanna stick around and build this thing then weve got work to do

Great job

So whats going on

I hear footsteps

Are

are people sitting back down or

Okay theyre picking up their bags

That could be good

Okay

So what theyre leaving or

A few are

Okay whats a few

Its more than a few

Whats that mean

Like whats more than a few five

Double digits

It might be easier to say how many are staying

Its uh

Its two

What

Okay

So uh Richard what

What do you wanna do here

What are you talking about

Im doing it

Sorry

Im a coder Jared

So Im gonna code

And if I have to build my entire new fucking internet by myself I'll do that so

Oh dear

I like it

Its just so edgy

Banksy is a very edgy artist

The edgiest

What is this

Banksy is insisting his signature be on his work

This is supposed to be my signature

On what planet does a signature have a signature on it

Im afraid its nonnegotiable

The fucking balls on this egomaniac

You know what

fuck Banksy




    push

Were on a campus full of literally thousands of the greatest creative minds in the world

Lets just crowd source it with our employees

Well make it a contest

People will feel empowered and part of the team

And it wont cost us shit

You see

This is what a benevolent leader does

Make it happen

Sir is this a good time

Its a great time

I just fired Banksy

Banksy the vandal

The very one

Now what do you have for me

Good news

Im hearing that Pied Piper is in a freefall

From whom

All I can say without implicating you is that Ive instituted an operation to safeguard our interests

Im calling it Project Washburn What Im planning to

Hoover youre implicating me

Are we bad people for leaving Richard there to work by himself

Weve been coding for 48 hours straight

I could give a shit about deontological ethics

Yang

There better not be a Chinaman in my bed

That is racist

Yes

I am racist

Stupid Errich

Big mortgage

Seven credit cards

Not even one with miles

fucking loser

It almost not worth to take his house from him

Fat fuck

Speaking of crazy bills you know how much its going to cost to fix my Tesla

17000

I cant afford to pay that

But I cant afford not to pay it

If I dont fix my Tesla Gilfoyle wins

And I need to really shove it up his ass

Wait

Do I really hate someone so much that defeating them is worth more than money

Is that really what Ive become

Yeah it is

Im gonna pay it

Thanks JianYang

I'll pay too

fuck you Errich

You cant just leave your bikecar in my Teslas spot and Uber home

Thats not fair Gilfoyle

Mmm you dont seem to understand

Its my spot now

What are they doing back

Hey

Where have you been

Sleeping

What We assumed you guys were right behind us

Whats happening

Oh

Something

Something is happening

When you left I thought he was fried

Okay

Because his shoulders were all tight and he wouldnt answer to his name and his eyes went dead like when I tell him I love him

But then he just got stronger and he started picking up speed so I texted a few of the Sliceline guys and then they texted some of the Optimoji guys and they all wanted to see it

Richard has finished the scheduler and is almost ready to merge the serverless runtime

Look look

He implemented all those tasks

By himself

That was supposed to take the whole team four days

Its amazing

I mean I feel

I feel like Mary Magdalene on resurrection day

And thats not the greatest miracle of all

Look

Look at the coders

Theyre all wearing Pied Piper hoodies

He pushed another commit

What the fuck

Flawless

Right

Um it takes a while to read a whole commit

Theyve been cheering after every commit

I mean they havent but its

Its great

I thought I had to shit my pants

So I crouched

I actually vomited

Fightorflight reflex kicked in and I just

Richard

Richard

Richard

Hey buddy boy

Oh there he is

Whats

Whats going on

Dont flip out okay

But you have been in a coma for four years

What

Thats correct

In fact Im a robot

The real Dr

Crawford died heroically in the water wars of 2020

Jokes Richard

Im just joking around

What did you sell your sense of humor

Youve just been out for about six hours

You were not even unconscious really just asleep

But you did lose a whole lot of blood

I just hope they put the right kind back in

Wait are you still riffing

I dont know

Richard heres the bad news your arms and your torso took the brunt of the glass

If youd cut your face up some we couldve gotten insurance to pay for a whole remodel

Gotta you know

give the old schnozzle a muchneeded trim you know what Im talking about

You gotta hate it as much as everybody else

So what happened

What were you trying to ride one of those hover boards around your office like a nincompoop

Um no

I

I guess I just got a little lost in the work

All right

Hop in Frankenstein

Lets get you out of here

Oh uh

I think what youre trying to say is Frankensteins monster

What

I think you mean to call me Frankensteins monster cause Frankenstein is the

Oh youre one of those guys huh

No Im just

the doctors name is Frankenstein

I know

Its just an annoying thing to point out

If you want people to like you just go along with what they say and have fun

What

Richard

You shouldve called

I wouldve picked you up

Whats everybody doing here

The fuck does it look like

Were working

Look at em all Richard

I mean sure a threeday orientation mightve been just as effective and less bloody but it wasnt you

But you found your own way to get these men and women these Pipers to follow you

You looked at these people and you said I may not be an inspiring speaker

I may be twitchy and I might be strange and I might vomit and I might defecate in my pants and I might throw myself through a window

But I believe in this company so much I'll work so hard I'll literally risk my life for it And that is the kind of leader these people wanna follow

Because now they know nothing is gonna stop you

All right then

Gavin Belsons office please

I need to talk to Hoover

Its Jeff Washburn

Yes thank you

This one came in third with 46 votes

Cute

Next

This one came in second with 374 votes

Nice feels solid

And with 9986 votes this by far was Hoolis favorite

Hmm I like it

Its bold

Gavin B

Mr

Hoover

You have a phone call

He said youd know what it was regarding

A Mr

Jeff Washburn

I am so exhausted

But the backseat of my Teslas really comfy though right Richard

Definitely worth all the money Im spending on it

Good purchase

Not a mistake

Uh

my key doesnt work

Uh let me try mine

What the fuck

Mine doesnt work either

Yang

Move

Do you have a app idea

No

Sorry

Errich is gone

This is my incubator now

What

Your things are over there

What the fuck

You just took our shit and threw it on the lawn

Gilfoyle you are racist

And Richard

you are ugly

The Errich administration is over

What

What the fuck

You cant just kick us out JianYang

Sorry

You are victims of a circumstance

Thank you

JianYang

What the fuck

Why does the whole neighborhood smell like bacon

 Have no place to go   Have no place to go darling   Have no place to go   Darling   Have no place to go   Have no place to go darling   Have no place to go   Have no place to go darling   When that train roll up now   I come walking out   Come walking out out out   When that that train roll up now   I come walking out   Come walking out  Richard this is Dana CEO of Quiver

I did not tell Dana about this

Look Richard I think we should work together

Gilfoyles ended up saving the day with all the Seppen smart fridges

Totally illegal

I came here to cut down your server bills

In exchange I need you to do something for me

Seppen is suing us for ten million in damages
