All right lets do an exercise

You can build anything in the world you want with your compression

Whats it gonna be

Three two one go

A A new internet

What I am your lead investor

You will respect me as such

I do not respect you because you are fat and poor

So youre telling me that the perfect application of my algorithm belongs to Gavin fucking Belson

We need his patent and his funding

Eventually this will render every server obsolete

Holy shit

Welcome to the future Gavin

Whoa

Oh no

Oh no

Son of a bitch

I have spoken to our top LPs to start a new firm

Would you care to jump ship with me

You are after all my best friend

What

Gavin just fucked off to go find himself who knows where

Its the patent

He just signed over full ownership to me

Theres a loud man here to see you

Welcome home and congratulations on getting your business back

Thank you and I should congratulate you on your breakthrough

I can help you get where you wanna go

Im pretty sure I know where I wanna go and how to get there

I shall look forward to the fight

Jesus what the hell did he order

Oh

No

No no no no

Stop

Stop it stop it

Oh my God

These are our new offices

Richard Yeah

Well this is just the lobby

Were up there on the second floor but yup

These are so nice

Theres a fireplace

Oh

I am a sucker for an intuitive kitchen layout

Follow me right up here

Trust me youre gonna love it

Gilfoyle Its hard to believe your pathological inability to make a decision finally paid off

Jared Wow

Richard well done

Dude

Look at this place huh

Jared Oh I love it

So when do these guys move out

Oh no this isnt our space

Our sublease is straight through here

Okay

I welcome you to Pied Pipers new home

Huh Hoohoohoo

Its its very white

Yeah its minimalist you know

Sharp clean lines

I was thinking about maybe putting my desk here in this corner

Jared you over here right

Dinesh Gilfoyle maybe up against this wall or over there

You know just take a minute walk around the space see where the mojo takes you

I mean weve got some good feng shui in here

Really good

Richard the plan was to hire 15 coders and some assistants and and other staff

Where exactly would we put them

Easy

Right around here

Look guys

the price is unbelievable

Im just happy that we got to it when we did before anyone else

I I emphatically vote that we move on this now if we all agree

I mean we do agree right

I cannot put this delicately so Are you fucking kidding me dude

You want us to work in here

This is a fucking black site Richard

A black site would actually be better because at least wed be protected by the Geneva Convention

This is fucking with my eyes

Can I get outta here

Okay ha hang on

Richard can I talk to you for one second please privately

Richard Sure

Ah

See

Plenty of outlets

Richard

what are you doing

We can easily afford a place with windows and

air where you can maintain a connection to time and space

If if we spend all that money its gone

Okay dont you remember Jack Barker squandering all our runway for those fancy offices or Russ Hanneman spending nearly every cent we had on fucking swag

Im sorry man we do not get another chance

This is it

Gilfoyle There is no point whispering

We can hear every fucking word you say in this sweatbox

I can hear you gulping Richard

No you cant

Richard it is my firm opinion that if we were to take this space our new hires wouldnt be coding they would be having panic attacks

No come on

Im doing a really good job of hiding it but Im having one right now

I gotta get the fuck outta here

Jared you okay

I will not be back

Wait guys hold on

Jared Im gonna get you some water okay

Richard Okay what about this guy Chris Berger

Hes a very skilled engineer

He was very funny when we met with him

I think hed be great

He was oddly tall dont you think

Gilfoyle Yeah pass

Alright what about Blake Kang

His beard hair looked like head hair

And his head hair looked like beard hair

Come on

Its been a fucking month

I got us these expensiveass offices because you wanted them and now theyre just sitting here empty because you guys wont agree on anyone

Look Im going to be seeing Laurie Bream at this stupid Innovation Hall of Fame event tonight and shes gonna ask how hiring is going

Shes 11 months pregnant and highly irritable

What am I going to tell her

That weve just been dicking around the whole time

Were not dicking around

Really

What about this

Gilfoyle Touch√©

He sent in a professional headshot

We had no choice

Plus his face looks like a taint

Okay yeah fair

But look I sent you 63 good people

I spared you kilt guy openly altright guy obviously closeted altright guy and the guy with the stupid fucking pizza app

It was so lame it would somehow make you hate pizza

You have to choose

Dude its easy for you to say

Youre gonna be off CEOing going to fancy galas

Were the ones who have to like be in the engine room with these clowns

Gilfoyle They have to meet our rigorous standards

I mean look at the three weve already hired

Just look at them

There they are

Stallions

Gilfoyle Each one more magnificent than the last

Dinesh Perfect

Yeah theyre glorious obviously but thats only three of them and theyre luxuriating here in this huge fucking palace that is costing us a fortune so hurry up and pick these fucking coders and stop acting like a couple of spoiled millionaires

Alright Richard your tuxedo is pressed and ready for the gala

I put a touch of mint in the steamer

Youre gonna look like Richard Gere from Pretty Woman Maybe tonight youll fall for a radiant sex worker

During my sabbatical from Hooli I toured the wonders of the world seeking inspiration from mankinds greatest achievements the Parthenon Angkor Wat the Great Pyramid of Giza

But it wasnt until my flight home that I had my epiphany

Yes those wonders are visited by thousands of people every year but 24 million people visit HooliSearch every minute

God what a fucking douchebag

Gavin And then it occurred to me

What I have built is a far greater achievement than any of the ancient world

And the ideal version of myself was the man I already was

Thank you

Richard

Richard Hendricks

Oh

Huh

Okay

Yeah hi Duncan

Yeah

Me and my guys were just talking about you and your pizza app

Oh yeah

I bet

Our algorithm finds you the cheapest fastest pizza and its its awesome

Yeah

Its actually so awesome

Definitely

that oh man Im gonna Im gonna have to pull my resume

Oh youre pulling your Oh no

Yeah I just dont feel as psyched about it as I do about Sliceline

Sliceline

Thats the name of your app

Yeah

Oh God

Great

Yeah its a pun

Is it

Yeah

It rhymes with Priceline

Okay

Just so it rhymes

Okay

Yeah

Its a rhyming pun

Anyway there might be some major VCs around here so I gotta go mingle

Okay

Its the its the worst part of this job

Am I right

Im kidding

Its the best part of the job

Okay

What an asshole

Richard

Gavin hello

Dont you look cute in your Sunday best

Hows that little bunny Internet going

Mmm

New Internet

New

Unlike your old Internet

You know Im glad I ran into you Richard

I was actually starting to feel bad about what I did today

Oh Invent the MOSFET transistor Its old technology

Its very old like you

No

Ive heard that youre trying to staff up

Over the past few months youve met with just about every distributed systems developer in the Valley

Okay well not everyone

63 of them and as of 430 pm

this afternoon I hired them all 63 of them

Yeah I had to pay through the nose but you know what

 That look right there on your face

It makes it worth every penny

You know what

Enjoy the reception Richard

You too

Jared Yeah he wasnt bluffing

He hired all of them

Even my boy Blake Kang

He was a good one

Im sorry uh your boy

I thought his hair was backwards

You guys were lukewarm on him and everybody else for all kinds of stupid reasons

Well now that theyre unavailable their strengths are more readily apparent

And I dont want to point fingers but we wouldnt be here if you hadnt let Gilfoyle and me waste so much time being picky

What

I was dying to move faster

I was just respecting your process

Our process sucks

Your inability to stop us from sucking is a failure of leadership

At least we still have the stallions

Ah

Those stallions

Look at em

Magnificent

Sit back down

Just sit in your chairs

Jared um

call altright guy and cologne boy and all the other rejects and

set meetings

Well I did a little digging on the altright guy and hes pretty involved in a campaign to eliminate black emojis but there might be another option

Do you remember Kira Pickford

Yes actually

Yeah good coder but she had her own company

Well thats true except that her company Optimoji just lost their second round of funding so theyre basically on life support

So

So what if instead of building a team we acquired one

Dinesh But Optimoji has 30 people

We only need 12

Well well just insist that she let the other 18 go

We have a lot of leverage

Richard is a shrewd negotiator and Im you know spirited

Look Kira this is a fair offer

But

Ive got 30 great guys

Were like family and you only wanna bring along 12

I have to do whats right by my guys

Look I know what its like to only be able to rescue half your family and its awful but what can you do

Shh shh

Sometimes theres only one Jared okay stop

Um look Kira youre not gonna find a better deal than that

Your company is close to bankruptcy and we all know that there are a lotta coders out there in this old town and we could go to any of em but we wanna go to you so

kinda feels like weve got all the cards here huh

Richard

You keep following me Im gonna call the cops

Im just kidding

Oh

Hey Im Duncan

Hey

Kira

Hey guess what company just got his Series A Term Sheet Oh the Sliceline

Congrats yeah

Duncan Yeah were staffing up like crazy

Speaking of staffing how about all those coders you lost man

Im sorry

That mustve been a real blow

What coders

Um Im sorry I dont mean to be rude but this is boring

Thank God I didnt accept your offer

Id be the only guy working for you now that Gavin Belson swooped in and tactically masshired every single distributed systems engineer you were looking at

Gavin hired all of Richards coders

Not everyone

Not everyone

Yup

The guy is savage and so are my guys if they dont get their caffeine so nice meeting you Kira

Cool

Cool cool

What were you saying about holding all the cards

All of my coders or none of them

Take it or leave it

Dinesh What

Gilfoyle What the fuck

Do you have Do you Dinesh JianYang

JianYang

would you please explain why we each found some random Chinese guy asleep in our beds

Yes you work all day

Your rooms are always empty so they use

The fuck they do

Yes its not your house

This is not your house either JianYang

This is Erlichs house

Do you think Erlich would want your guys here

No

Thats why I invite them because I hate Errich

We are not Erlich

You are from Errichs administration

No we are not

Nobody has heard from Erlich in months

This isnt working

Im gonna drag your cousin the fuck outta my lair

JianYang No this is my cousin

Engineers welcome

You are 63 of the top distributed systems developers in the Valley and were looking forward to working with you

Hooli is the future and your future is

the Box Two

So are there any questions

Yes

Im sorry but what if we dont wanna work on that

Weird

This is our flagship product but Im sure wed all like to hear what you would like to work on

A decentralized Internet like we were going to build with Richard Hendricks

Actually thats the one thing we cant do here at Hooli

Yes

Sorry

You only hired us because Pied Piper wanted us right

Untrue

Go on

And Pied Piper only wanted us because of our ability to help build a decentralized Internet

Cant speak to that

Continue

And youre telling us that even if we want to we cant build a decentralized Internet here

May I ask why not

Because Richard owns the patent for it

Yes third row red hoodie

How did he get it

I gave it to him

You in the back

Why did you do that

It was a Buddhist act of selflessness

Well Im also a Buddhist and I would never give him the patent

I mean once he builds that Internet hes gonna render Hoolis entire webbased ecosystem completely obsolete

I mean everything youre doing here is antiquated

Thats not a question

Thats a statement

You know what

fuck you guys

I dont want you working on my box

Its too good for you

Antiquated

Why did you all take my money then you entitled little pricks

You all think youre John Lennon until someone waves a dollar in your face

You know what

Get outta here

Go on just wander the campus for four years until you vest

See what I care

Im serious

Go

Goodbye

Thank you very much

Assholes

Antiquated

fuck do they think they are

Im in the Innovation Hall of Fame

Are they

Speaking of they sent over the official inductees portrait

You and your peers

Handsome bunch

fuck

fuck

So Mr

Yang Its Mr

Jian

In China last name comes first

Okay

Mr

Jian you say that Erlich Bachman wrote this letter

to you

Yes

This is Erlich

Hello

I am gone but JianYang is a very good friend and very smart

I want him to be the leader of the house and control all of the friends

Goodbye

Bachman Erlich Yes

I want his house

Thank you

Okay I dont technically represent Mr

Bachman

Im Pied Pipers corporate counsel so my exposure to Bachman pertains only to his 10 ownership of the business

Errich owns 10 of Pied Piper

This was not a lie

Sadly no thats very very real

Thats worth a lot of money

Its promising tech

One day it could be worth a shitton

Shitton

Yes

Mr

Jian you seem like a good guy

Um this letter is not a legal document

I mean maybe a skilled attorney could make a case that in the absence of an existing will this would serve as one in the case of Bachmans death but as far as I can tell the guy is not

Dead

Yes

Errich is dead

Do you happen to have

a death certificate or any any form of proof of Yes

I can get it now

Richard Our deal with Kira is for 30 fucking coders

Where in the hell are we gonna put them

Well I suppose we could put three more workstations here and then two more over there

Itd be crowded but cozy

Theyll be all holed up together like the Branch Davidians

Yeah but I mean are we sure this is the right thing to do

I mean I dont want to crowd the stallions

Are we sure taking on all 30 of Kiras guys is the right move

We can get up and running

They all know each other so we wont have to play the name game

Yeah

Ron hello

Hey buddy

Hang on just a second

No the the exit is the exit is the other way

God damn it

Um Richie you know a guy named Jee Jan

Uh no

Well I know a Jan the Man but shes a woman

Look did you did you talk to the Optimoji board yet

Uh did we close the deal

Uh well a deal closed

Another bidder came in with a better offer so they went with them

Richard  What

Was it Gavin fucking Belson again

Ron  No it was a new company

Real smart clever name

Sort of a pun that rhymes

Oh hello dickheads




    push

I hope Im not interrupting your plotting you sneaky little dinks

Kira you and I had a deal okay

So fuck you fuck you and fuck you

Man What did he say

Not you

Just e everyone

I meant fuck all of you

No one specific

Richard you lowballed me

Mmm

Remember

Well Duncan here said he wanted to grow fast as balls

He said he was psyched

Yeah I am psyched

Id hire a million people if I could

See if I have to sell my company I might as well sell it to the CEO who actually wants all of us

Its pizza Kira

Richard were just three CEOs trying to do right by our companies

Okay you know what

Im glad you turned us down because I dont want to work with anyone who wants to work with this

meathead

Im taking these

Im taking all of them

Maybe just take one

You have like four employees

Richard Ha

Ah shit

Gavin Throw it away

Patrice Id like to welcome you back to the Hooli family

Its wonderful to be back Gavin

Sadly the timing couldnt be worse

Those codemonkeys I just hired were right about one thing Making Jacks box the flagship product of this company will send us down a path to technological irrelevance from which we will never return

But in light of the time and resources weve invested in this product convincing the board and our shareholders to simply scrap it will be nearly impossible

Our company is too big to turn around that quickly

Gavin what if you launched a new product to help us correct course

Absolutely

Look at all the products youve brought to market over the years

Gavin Hmm

True

I did invent the HooliPod and the HooliPad and the HooliPad Pro but a man only has so many gamechanging inventions in him

And technically all the products he just named were moneylosers

I mean you could argue wed have been better off if hed never invented any of that stuff

Hoover

Hoover Sir

Patrice can I talk to you outside for a second

Anyway if Jack Barkers insidious box is allowed to go to market we may all lose our jobs

We may all go the way of Patrice

But we must fight it

We cannot sacrifice our longterm wellbeing in the interest of paltry shortterm profits

Well theyre not paltry exactly

Did you not see the preorder figures for the Box Two

They came in this morning

Holy shit

Are these right

How many quarters is this

Just one

The Box Two will be by far the most lucrative new product weve ever released

fucking Sliceline

Plus his fancy hitech pizza tastes just like Dominos

Theres a reason for that

Check out the liner

Jared Oh yeah

I guess thats Dominos

We never had pizza cause my stepmom said Italians arent real white people

Hold on

Duncan doesnt even make his own pizza

He just orders it from Dominos and switches the boxes

He really is sneaky

Its not sneaky

Its stupid

Switching boxes costs a lot of money

Okay

How do you know

I need to prove Errichs dead so I want to ship a dead body from China but its hard to find a white body in China especially fat like Errich so I buy a fat white cadaver from Cincinnati medical school

But to ship to China then switch box then ship back its way too much money

Say that again

Like not one word of that made sense

Hold on

Just ju what uh

does anyone does anyone know the price of a Dominos pizza

A large 10 bucks

Okay well Sliceline sells theirs for nine

So

So were not fucked yet

That was kinda crazy Richard

That was I mean you threw a fullon tantrum

I know I know

I am so sorry

Its just I guess Im just a CEO trying to do right by my company

Like you guys

Speaking of business wow were having a hell of a night

Yeah well I would know

About 500 of those orders tonight are me

Oh

Richard you really didnt have to do that

But the peace offering is super appreciated

Yeah well I wouldnt really call it a peace offering

You see Duncan you took eight mil in funding right

And then you matched my offer to acquire Optimoji here from Kira but the thing is you cant sell your pizzas for nine bucks a pop without taking a bath can you

The reboxing the double delivery ugh

You lose what four bucks an order

Five actually

Were losing five bucks a pizza

Yeah

Only temporarily

So her team is gonna optimize our order routing and allocation and then well be cashflow positive

We can easily turn it around before we run out of money

Right

Yeah

Unless a lot of people buy your pizza very quickly

What are what are you doing

Well Duncan I can be a dickhead too

You see I have 13 million in my bank account and a very low payroll which affords me to buy a lot of tasty za before you can turn it around

Youre trying to bankrupt us

No Kira

Im simply trying to devalue your company so that I can make a lowball acquisition offer which you cannot refuse

Richard Im just gonna delete your account

You see my engineers already thought of that and they worked up a little botnet program

Thousands of fake users indistinguishable from real ones geolocated perfectly to maximize drive time and bleed your little greasebag operation dry

You know I may not have that many coders but the ones I do are stallions each one more magnificent than the last

Monica You spent 19000 on pizza

No 19000 on vengeance

Youre acquiring Sliceline who already acquired Optimoji

Richard youre talking about absorbing a staff of 50

How are you gonna spin this to Laurie

Well you said youd protect me from Laurie

I mean shes your partner

Are you afraid of her

Of course Im afraid of her

The woman got pregnant just to prove to me that she could do it without missing a day of work

Okay fair enough but maybe this one time you could take my side

I cannot take your side

Youre asking for 50 employees

Think of the Sorry I am late

Hey Laurie

Did you uh Induce

Yes this morning

and here I am

So Richard I received your email

I understand you wish to acquire a company called

Sliceline which themselves recently acquired a company called Optimoji

Yes and I will be firing both companies CEOs and taking on a total engineering team of about uh 50

Fifty

Monica you are okay with this

Well it shortens their runway significantly but you did say that you want them to grow Laurie

Yes but in this case it seems

reckless

However if you are on top of it Monica then

approved

Congratulations

Great

Thanks

And congratulations to you too

On

On the on your on your baby

Oh

This is awesome

Gavin is essentially doublingdown on the very thing we are destroying

Its like hes giving up

Maybe I shouldve ordered the nicer Tesla

Dinesh Ah

Oh gosh

Everyones here

Jared Richard

So many people

Richard

Hey

Hey

I thought youd want to give some opening remarks you know it being the first day and all just to set the tone

Ladies and gentlemen Richard Hendricks

Um

Um

Well its great to have everybody and

so many

f faces

Weve got a lot of

men and women here

And

we should remember that

So lets keep it clean

Um

its always a challenge

to get it Ive got I should probably more to say in a minute

I just have to go one one second in my office

and then well conclude

Uh he just needs a second in his office then hes gonna come back

Oh God

Dont tell anyone okay

Um Richard I know I know moneys tight but I think I might invest in a modesty panel for your desk

Richard What

 Yeah   The monkey speaks his mind   Now three monkeys sat in a coconut tree   Discussing things as they are said to be   Said one to other Now listen you two   Theres a certain rumor that cant be true   That man descended our noble race   Why the very idea   Is a big disgrace   And heres another thing   You will never see   A monkey building a fence   Around a coconut tree   And let the coconuts   Go to waste   Forbidding all the monkeys   To come and taste  You have petitioned to become the sole executor of the estate of Erlich Bachman

Erlich Bachman is dead

Oh

The Optimoji guys and the Sliceline guys they are united against me

Good news

Im hearing that Pied Piper is in freefall

If I have to build my entire new internet by myself I'll do that

You have been in a coma for four years

In fact Im a robot

Im just joking around

What did you sell your sense of humor

Come on

No
